Sort

Feel great right now (xx feel commands)

Wouldn't it feel great to get healthier, stronger and smarter every day?

How would you feel if you stood up straight right now, stretched, breathed in deeply, and thought
about how lucky you are to be alive. Right now. Give it a try. Now imagine you have a super
power. Everything you tell yourself to do, you'll actually do! Life will be pretty easy from here
forward, won't it? You could even tell yourself to enjoy the process. You're on your way to having
that power, and much more.

What else might you say to yourself? Eat healthy, sleep well, love yourself, your family, your
fellow man - you're off to a good start. The first step is to know that you can give yourself great
advice, and you can follow it. The world of happier, healthier people, starts today... With you.

Conversations come and go, some very few change your life forever. This book will change your
life. You're about to see the world in a whole new light. A light you'll see while everyone else
seems blind to it. The meaning of life, love, wealth, and fortune itself await you in these pages.

How many books have you read and not a single thing in your life got better for it? For a book to
have any value past its reading, it must benefit your life after you've closed the cover. If you have
to beat yourself up, figuring out how to use the information you get out of a book, it's not a great
book. A great book gives you easy to understand and use ideas that make your life better right
away. The secrets and strategies you discover in this book will start benefitting your life
immediately.

Dreams really do come true (xx jealousy commands)

Have you ever wondered why some people have so much, and others so little? How is it that such
a great difference can exist among men in this modern time? It's not an accident. The paths to
greatness have followed a similar form for thousands of years. Great things happen to people
every day, stack the odds in your favor, and one day people will be looking up to you, wondering
how you got so lucky.

Fulfill your destiny (xx cold reading)

If you are reading this page, I already know something great about you. You're the kind of person
that knows the future can be brighter. Your future. You believe in yourself. You know there's
better and worse ways to do things, and you prefer the better. You like to learn new things,
particularly things you'll be able to use. Your entire life has led up to this moment, this turning
point, where you found the book that would change your life forever. Today is that day. You will
dream the dream, then you will live it! Your life will exceed your wildest dreams.

Why write this book? (Xx show humanity, align values)

(insert content from letter to billionaires, interview with derose. Maximize the greed and
minimize risk by restricting the benefits to kids and the worthy.)

What is it people actually want in life? (Xx teasers here)

Scivivng (xx branding, self-reference)

Knowledge isn't power. Intelligent action is power.

Let's be serious. If reading a book on how to get what you wanted was all you needed to do,
well by golly, you'd see world full of fulfilled people. Knowledge is but the first step. The



habits built taking correct action are what do the heavy lifting. Knowledge without action is
like a car that's run out of gas. It could get you where you want to go and it's nice that you
have one, but you need the fuel.


Scivival

Defined

Sciviving: People so fulfilled that they have the time, money, and desire to invest in
their families survival.

Scivivors

Our core principles are that life has 9 parts
You: Mind, Body, Spirit
Amplifiers: Money, Power, Respect
Becomes you: Schedule, Environment, Experience

You are what you think, what you feel, and your body. You will become what you do,
what surrounds you, and the experiences you have. How fast and how well you
become your future self is amplified by the money, power, and relationships you
build.

We know that advancements in medicine have the greatest benefits for our loved
ones and ourselves. Science is the best tool we have to take mankind to the next
level. We fight the reaper on our feet while cowards kneel and pretend that nothing
can be done. When the genie grants us wishes, we wish for more wishes.

We know that a life well lived is one of balance, enjoying today to its fullest while
preparing for tomorrow. Lucky are we that being happier, healthier and loved adds
not only joy to our years, but years to our joy.

Life is Quality x Quantity
Quality

Being the best you, having the best things, relationships and experiences.
Quantity

A great life cut short is tragic.

The system

The systems that helped you into this world and that you may still operate in,
education, finance, politics, these things all affect you on a day to day basis.
Their scope however is usually so large and they have so much momentum that
they should be focused on separately from the things you can affect quickly and
easily in your day to day life. Understanding these larger systems is more
important the larger and larger your sphere of influence becomes, because, just
like giant ships the size of apartment buildings, there's still a single captain who
can turn the wheel and change direction. You may be that captain or have his
ear one day. (Xx would be funny to have a picture of someone twisting the
captains ear.)

The Magic Lens of Scivival

Splits the light of life into nine different wavelengths you can tune into. Xx (prism
image here with life splitting into these parts.) If you want your personality to shine a



pure white light, you need to have all of the colors in balance. When you're out of
balance, you tint everything you look at.

A pure white light makes it easier to see everything. Without balance, you will not see
things for what they really are, nor people. This is one of many gifts that living as a
Scivivalist will give you. You'll be able to see and understand things that most people
can't.

If you know about color mixing, you'll notice interesting things about which colors
represent which keys. Try mixing them together or breaking them into parts, For
instance Magenta is Red+Blue.

Splitting life into 3 sets of 3

while observing the present, the future, and the speed

Eating through the tasty bits of life

You can only focus on so much stuff at a time (chunking). Our brains are a
little like our mouths, in that when you want to eat a sandwich, you do it
in bites, and if you try to put too much sandwich in a single bite, the
chewing stops working, you just lock up. Your brain is a little bit like that,
it works most effectively when it's given just the right amount of
information to digest. That's why splitting quality of life into 3 groups of 3
is so useful.

3 is a magic number. Think of how many things come in 3's.

The magic of 3's.

We all have height, width and depth. We see color with Red, Green,
and Blue light sensing cells in our eyes. We describe sound as the
highs, mids, and lows, we describe sizes as small, medium, and
large. Even the saying blood sweat and tears was actually blood
sweat toil and tears, but we prefer 3's so that's the way we
remember it. It's also the least number of walls you need to enclose
a space, best sub positioning, seating position, speaker height,
seating height in room, l/3s for photography


































Include top middle bottom, and the minimum number of legs to
stand something up as 3. Need it to triangulate a signal. Too
listeners point the direction they hear it, and point at each other.
Make a triangle and you know where the source is. Inch, foot, mile.
Past, present, future. Hendriatiris. Input, process, output. Rule of
thirds in photography. Pi is basically 3.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule of three (writing)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lsocolon

tripartite motto.

The appeal of the three-fold pattern is illustrated by the
transformation of Winston Churchill 's reference to " blood, toil, tears
and sweat " (echoing Garibaldi and Theodore Roosevelt ) in popular
recollection to "blood, sweat and tears ."imeji Similarly, Thomas
Hobbes' Leviathan describes the importance of community, without
which life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". This
has been reduced to the commonly heard triad "nasty, brutish and
short."

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule of three (writing) >

Oath by a witness in a US court proceeding is asked to "tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth"

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule of three (writing) >

Which is similar to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The three Rs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy (philosophy)

My list of cool 3's seems to beat Wikipedia's
https://en.wikipedia.0rg/wiki/3 (number)

Now, you could say that all this 3 magic is a natural consequence of
counting starting with 1, which wouldn't be exciting, 2, which I'm
sure we could find much samples of cool pairs than triplets. And so
3 is the lowest countable number where more complicated effects
start happening, because the pairs can only be so exciting. Rock
paper scissors is more fun than just rock paper. Because they're so
effective in communicating, math, and building, I think it's worth it
to know the power of threes.

We split up the sounds we hear by frequency, high middle low. Hot,
cold, good. Dark, bright, good. Loud, quiet, good. Small, medium,
large.

We understand the world best in 3's.

Examples
















Understanding where things are

It's the best way to locate an idea in space.

We triangulate it. Subject, verb, object. Point, Direction, speed.

Some fun ways to remember the color guide are to notice how you
can mix and match some to make others, and associate them with
things you like in each subject.


The Symbol of scivival

The 9 points cover with the Scivive center

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram (geometry)

Scivive is a great name for a movement
It's an action.

The title Scivival is interesting as opposed to other belief items, because it entails the
thought of (xx change morality) mortality, the vival part kind of clues you in to
something that's coming to kill you whether it's someone who doesn't like you so
much or the passage of time. I think it's important to differentiate a belief in survival
through scientific advancement, and more than just survival we really want to do
everything better. You don't want to just have a life that sucks to last longer, you want
a great life that lasts longer, (xx meta) I think it's important to differentiate the word
scivive from Scientology, because they probably don't have any similarity
The meaning of life

Malformed question, quality x time, and nearly everything that increases time also increases
quality, so lucky us!

The meaning of life is quality times quantity, it is pretty easy to prove. Also, this an
impossible and incomplete question. What is the meaning of bread? Am I hungry, or am I
choking on it? Did I steal it, is it moldy? Anyway, there is no such thing as meaning, except
what you give it, and perhaps what other entities with power over you give it. Even that
changes, what you think about things changes with age, how you've been treated, and how
the world has changed. Why do I feel so compelled to venture down the rabbit hole of
intuition, superstition and the occult? Because it wastes a shit load of everyone's time. So
many people waste so much time in unenjoyable ways, when they could be wasting it in
more fun ways.

The emptiness of searching for meaning externally, Xx I think ending of sentence is
missing?oo

The system works better when people are different

We are all different, and even more different than these systems would have you
believe, and it is not an accident. We are supposed to be different, it's the reason we
have sex. In this world, during the course of life's existence there has always been
living things that make copies of themselves. The problem with just making a copy of
yourself is that it doesn't leave much room for the next generation to be better than
you. There is a little bit of change introduced from the inaccurate copying, you could
call them mutations. Then sex came along, and the world rejoiced. Sex is a great way
to get offspring to have a chance to be better than what came before them. Not only



do you have lots and lots of change, because you're quite literally mixing the
blueprints of two entirely (I hope) different people. If you have kids with people
biologically related to you, it leads to bad health outcomes for the kids, and in many
places is illegal.

With sex, between not biologically related partners, you also get this great effect of
both (hopefully) of the partners choosing the traits that they like the most, out of
(hopefully) a large pool of potential partners. That, you see, is how you get faster and
faster, smarter and smarter, prettier and prettier people as a result of lots and lots of
years of everyone choosing their favorites and mixing it up.

Why do I mention all of this about sex in a chapter about categorizing life, so you can
kick ass in all its good areas and not miss any through lack of clarity? Because if it is
true that we're all different, and it's true that we are supposed to be (species such as
humans with wide variations in abilities, desires, and behaviors are vastly superior in
survival to one trick ponies, where if the situation changes only a small bit, everyone
can get wiped out), if you don't have variation in your species, you are not durable.
The world is constantly changing, it's good to be durable. Being an omnivore is fun.

Thus, if it's good that we are all different, if it's good that we are continually more
different than what came before us, then it's also good that we don't all have the
same needs in the same priority. Therefore, all of the hierarchies of the needs of men,
such as Maslow's, are deeply flawed from the start assuming that people are so
similar to have the same needs in the same orders as everyone else. I assure you,
they do not, which is good news for humanity. Xx Those are just basic needs? I think at
least the lowest one is the same for everyone.

If we spent time analyzing how wrong everyone is and has been on everything, we
would be here for all time. Much better that we use our short and valuable time
together focusing on what works, and not what doesn't work.

Thus, your meaning of life should be slightly different from that of many other people.
There is robustness for the system through diversity of opinion and behavior.

Failed philosophies (xx us vs them)(xx tread lightly with shit talk, better to append than replace)

Xx Most philosophers weren't very successful

Philosophy and most other ity's and ism's do not pay the profits

to their followers that they should. This is because the questions they attempt to answer are
usually totally useless to you. If you like, or dislike capitalism, what say have you regarding
its deployment in the world? If you like or dislike man's relationships with the companies
that employee him, as much of Marxism is concerned with, what can you do with that
belief?

Most books appear more useful than they are

Specific advice benefits the reader more at the cost of the writer

Some "advice guys" are afraid to give you specific advice, they like to leave their
market appeal broad by being vague in what they tell you. I prefer to tell you the
truth. I'll tell you what's good for you where I can, at the cost of cool points.

Whoever influences you first sets your bias.



As a young man, you come in to this world being influenced from all angles.


Many great men have been forced into greatness because of harsh circumstances. Life is a
many splendored thing. Often times what you thought was a curse turns out to be a
blessing. All of us have the fortune of misfortune. The most respected and successful people
in this world have always had one or more hardships early in life. If you were to find
someone who you thought had no hardship, upon questioning them, you'd likely find they
found discomfort in an area you may never have thought of, or not even approve of, but
was real for them.

We stand on the backs of giants

We speak languages we didn't invent, and travel on roads we didn't pave. So too are most of
the thoughts we have handed down to us, without needing to invent them ourselves. Ism's
and ity's give us paths to follow, and billions do. The playbooks and perspectives of
organizing the world into parts, and suggested actions on those parts, are quite few really.

Philosophy, and communism, capitalism, marxism, are all interesting ways to see the world,
however ultimiately not very useful to you, as they don't really answer the more important
questions. What do YOU do. What can you do better to get what you want out of life.

Paths laid out for us

Inside of all of us there is a circuitry, which has served our ancestors for thousands upon
thousands of years. It is with you today because it works. Nature tends to get rid of things
that don't work. Oddly, nature tends to get rid of everything over time. We should make
that another chapter called "99 percent of everything that has ever existed is permanently
extinct". It's an amazing fact really. Ok, back to the circuitry.

Remember earlier in this fine book I told you that when you come into the world, you are
influenced from all angles. Those angles are not only external. They are internal to you as
well, both mental and chemical. The influence of heredity, custom, location, it all leaves a
mark. When I travel the world, people easily hear that I'm American by the way that I speak.
They have preconceived notions about what it means to be American, how Americans act,
and of what use we are. If you wanted to ask someone how to make great tea, you'd likely
rather ask an Englishman as its much more popular there. If you wanted to know how to
throw a football, you'd be better off asking an American.

The influence of your parents, geography, language, skin color, education, natural abilities
and talents will all play a role on how you turn out in life. Here's the most interesting part,
the most interesting part of all. Not all of those things put together, the entire mass of all of
it, will ever compare to your drive. A driven man can overcome great adversity and
sometimes even become a hero.

There is a special place in our souls for the role of hero. When we see someone do
something amazing, in the Olympics or on the battlefield or at home, there's a calling to
some part of us that wants to greatly reward them and rejoice, because they brought
something into reality we've so often dreamt of. Even if not conscious, some part of us
knows that what they did was great and we should smile and stand tall in admiration.

As it stands, I'd say my favorite quote of all time is "Nothing in the world can take the place
of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.



Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full
of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan
Press On! has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."

Alot of people that haven't read the The Art of War like to shit talk it, because they say that
everyone that reads it tries to turn everything else into war so the learning of the book can
be applied. If people that read it are misproperly applying it, then sure. In reality, what you
will find out is that the conflicts that exist in war also exist outside of war. Just as Shakespere
might say something along the lines of "to thy ownself be true", may be biblical aswell. If
you google the phrase "Know thy Enemy", you will come up with Sun Tzu, the 2500 year old
book, and that phrase has been adapted through the centuries, many many centuries.

Originally it was "If you know thyself, with every battle you will also have a loss. If you know
thyself and your enemy, you can fight a hundred balltles without a loss. If you know the
enemy but not thyself, you will also lose a fair amount of your battles." How knowing
yourself and your enemy has to be war, I dont really believe is the case. I think that knowing
yourself can exist in all formats that are not war. I think that knowing the other thing which
is the thing you are pushing against, which might not be another conscious actor, it might be
the cold, it might be lazyness, it might be cooking food properly. Every good story is pushed
against some weight. Therefore the statement "Know thyself & thy enemy" is super useful in
all contexts, particularily those outside of war. Now much of what he said is probably alot
easier adapted for war-like use, however, my point is the reason that book has lasted for
2500 years as a great book to read and get advice from isn't because we are all warriors and
generals and constantly at war, it's because it's universally bad ass and good useful advice in
alot of things that are not war, because conflict and strategy and effort are required in
nearly all important areas of life.

What an absolutely fantastic quote! This quote is around 100 years old. It's funny how good
advice really never expires. If you care to look, you can find great advice that is literally
thousands of years old. Still good!

(*xx Maybe what's actually most important to you isn't the cool novel shit that I came up
with that makes me feel my book is valid, maybe what you need is the basic shit that got me
to the position where I could build those ideas. Maybe that same basic shit gets you at a
position where you can build and give back. I.e. don't be so in love with the ideas you built
after you achieved, pay homage to the ideas that allowed you to achieve as well. The
precedent ideas.)(xx actionable, verify that precedent generic useful ideas aren't forgotten
because you internally value more all the *new to you, or generated by you ideas.)

Every path gets taken

People will follow all the paths, advertise more good paths to outcompete the bad ones
When you understand the whole system, when you see the earth as a tiny blue dot, you can
play in the game when you want, and you can be ok with not playing the game, because you
know what all the endings of the game look like

ALL paths shall be followed, even fake ones you made up for shits and giggles, so spamming
good ones Is a great idea, it's a contact sport (James Randi fake mystic creation story, the
curse of the scammed xx what specifically did he call it)

Stockpiling food and ammunition feels great but doesn't pay off



Survivalists and preppers spend lots of time and money on things that rarely pay off. The
survivalists of the 50's prepared for a Russian invasion, then got killed by the same boring
stuff that killed most of their ancestors. You're much more likely to die with a whimper than
a bang these days.

Book's design (xx me me rap)

Artful beats accurate

It was interesting to me when I decided to do things less accurately, but felt better. For
instance, including spirit as a section. The way most people would understand spirit is as
something that is beyond them, past them, deeper than them. It's beyond personality, it's
beyond behavior. I don't believe in that shit, but since I know everyone else does to such a
great degree, I'm going to be inaccurate and I'm going to use spirit. But, I'm not going to use
it the way that they do. I'm going to say it's the emotions and drives that drive you, which
most people would probably put under mind, but it's close enough to ephemeral and artsy-
fartsy and ghostlike that they'll probably also accept it under spirit.

It was interesting to me that I made the decision to choose feels good, emotionally
compelling and easier to digest instead of more accurate, alien and off-putting and less
likely to execute and do. Today, I'm proud to say that I made a logical extension to support
that decision, which I'm proud enough of to make a recording now. If you must choose
between accuracy and feels good, and the feels good is about 80 % as accurate as the super
accurate, you should definitely go with the feels good because in the grand scheme of
things, these are not recipes that will be followed to the letter. People will only perform a
very, very, very, very small - less than 1 % subset - of the shit that you tell them to do.

If you make a small adjustment for the sake of being able to remember, transmit or being
sticky or feeling better about it, or addressing or synchronizing with a common parable that
people believe in, such as "there's no free lunch" or "time heals all wounds" - euphemisms
like that, then you're better off doing it, because they're unlikely to execute the specific
thing that you weren't 100% accurate on. Therefore, the things that they were more likely
to execute on, which is the other 99% of stuff you're enhancing by not alienating with
unspecific language or overly specific language that has no heart and no feel and take, and
stops them and makes them thing for a long time instead of just continuing the digestion
train, the yes train, the rapport. Breaking rapport for no good reason is a bad strategy. Xx
Paragraph needs revising, sentences are too long

If you can't say something simply, you don't understand it well enough. Simplicity is power.

Most people are beginners

I think that most people haven't completed reading any self-help material, let alone most of
the classics in it, so let's not just assume they are where you are, and that they don't need to
know what you already take for granted.

Most people don't follow their own advice, let alone yours

If I wrote a book that said eat healthy, brush your teeth, exercise, no one would read it.

What people want to read is the shit they have not heard a million times. The ideas that you
have to hear about are novel, unique, outrageous, and thus it makes a book worth reading.

The best books are magnifying glasses, their value is all the things they don't show.

The most important part of writing a book isn't to present all the data you have on a thing.

In an ideal world, where one has a shitload of memory and a shitload of Internet access -
they already have access to everything in the world. What they need from you is less, not



more. They don't need more data, they need less data. You need to refine and hone their
limited attention span on something that is truly beneficial to them, not to tell them a
million things to confuse the fucking issue. Bruce Lee: "I fear not the man who has practiced
10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."

Get more out of the book (xx open mind, focus on results)

Demand results from your study of this work

A book is as good as the actions you take from it and by proxy the actions others may take
from it through the ideas passing through you. If I wrote a book where you would follow the
instructions without all the convincing filler text, would it be the greatest book?

Demand more from your life. Low expectations are the father of regret. If all your dreams
came true instantly, what would your life look like? Specifically. Set a new standard. Dream
the dream. Live the dream. In this world, you're either making your dreams come true, or
someone else's.

Take Responsibility, Own your future

This is meant to change your life, to improve the actions you take. This is not meant to add
to the long list of things you know you should do that you know you're not doing.

Life Schedule

You're only awake 16 hours a day. Now subtract out all the hours where you have to
be doing something. How many hours are left? 3? This is your free time. Choose
wisely how you spend these precious few hours.

Prioritization

Deadlines

If your schedule hasn't changed when you finish this book, read it again, because
you're only going to get the improvement you want in your life when it's scheduled
and acted on.

You never step in the same river twice. It changes, and over time, so do you.

When you read with a result in mind, you notice and remember the parts that are most
important for you to remember. Scivive offers something different to each person that
reads it. Everyone is at a different place in their journey. As you progress, you'll see that it
adds new meaning to parts that didn't seem so special to you the first time around.

A real conversation is the highest aspiration of a well written book

Most books are nothing like a conversation. In a conversation of equals, you listen at least as
much as you speak. The dazed look on one of your faces easily lets you know when you
need to spend more time explaining something. Sometimes you can feel what's going on
inside your conversation partner's mind. You can see his mouth eager and waiting for a
pause, any pause will do, to add to the conversation. A conversation where everyone is
learning and building is a beautiful thing. The book is a mere two dimensional
representation of such a glorious event.

If what you have to say is important enough to make into a book, then it is surely important
enough to be written in a language your audience understands. If you want to have a good
time speaking with teenagers, the elderly, hippies and CEO's, you'd better learn to speak a
few different languages. I truly believe that if you speak to a man as his friend, interested in
what he is interested in, you can share a great bond.


Since I'm not with you now to ask you personally about the things you care about, we're
going to have to settle for you choosing your own adventure. You can leave the parts of this



conversation that are least important to you for last. What we're going to cover together in
this book is so broad and touches so many people in so many places, that it can be seen
from hundreds of perspectives. I'm quite sure where one person finds an idea exciting,
another will be enraged. What could be more fun!

An open mind learns better, there’s time to argue after
Greatest profit in controversial things

We deal in controversial things, for those are the things that have the most profit. The
more people that are doing a thing wrong, the more profit there is in changing to
doing it right. Sadly, people doing things wrong usually think they're doing them right,
and perhaps better than everyone else. Telling people what they're doing wrong, and
how to do it better usually pisses them off.

Find freedom by not becoming the devil's advocate

We're lucky enough when we meet someone who is not only passionate about that
which they speak but perhaps even knowledgeable as well. We would obviously want
to impress such a person speaking to us, so as to be worth of the conversation. What
are the most common ways you've seen this happen yourself? You can't very well
repeat back the same ideas that were just given to you, you might come up with a
novel idea that could add to his, however, he's likely more knowledgeable and been
thinking about it for longer, which may be why he brought the topic up in the first
place. It would be the most impressive thing that could be done, if you could construct
on top of his idea and make it stronger.

There is an easy way though, a shortcut to feeling important - destruction! Let him
know why he's wrong. Let him know why it won't work, shouldn't work, can't work.
This is great stuff, where in the original conversation, if you only added a small icing
on his idea cake, you'd seem only to be an accessory. Now that you disagree with him,
you are his equal or greater! Screw the quest for truth, that pays off only after many
days, feeling important pays off right now! Think about the last time you tried to
explain to someone that they were doing something wrong, and remember the
mental gymnastics you might have witnessed. It takes a great man to skip the easy
route, bide their time in silence, thinking of something great to add. When the gambit
pays off, and you can construct with your speaking buddy instead of disagreeing,
friendships are made.

Imagine how many different ways there are to believe about a thing. Take for instance
bicycles. Some people absolutely hate it when they're driving, and yet another silly
bicycle is so damn close to his side view mirror that it looks like they'll hit each other,
what stress. Bikes are the enemy. Yet another chance to throw my life away, if I nudge
this flimsy human with my car, he'll likely sprawl into 100 pieces and I'll spend the rest
of my days in prison. Now, from the bicycler's perspective, why would I waste money
on gas and a car, and car insurance, when I need to exercise for my health anyway?
Why not save the environment, my wallet and my heart and bicycle to work! If I run
over someone with my bike instead of my car, it's likely there will be no fatalities or
jail time involved, too. Two people with two different perspectives, which one is right?
Perhaps both at different times?


These kinds of very hard to square wars of perspective are happening all the time.
Imagine how much easier it is to find disagreement instead of construction on ideas.



We humans are very interesting, in that we're very good at not understanding things,
when we don't want to. There's a couple old sayings that encompass the idea pretty
well. 1. You cannot wake a man pretending to sleep. 2. It is difficult to get a man to
understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it! Why
must this be mentioned? Because sometimes, we are that man. Anyone who has ever
changed his mind about something was likely not happy to hear someone disagreeing
with them at the start of the conversation. Once we've changed our mind about
something, we quickly forget how strongly we used to believe in the other direction.
No one likes to think that they were ever wrong, and likely even less, that they'll be
wrong again sometime soon.

You're going to get the most out of this book, and life, if you find ways to squeeze the
knowledge out where it’s useful, and focus on learning and becoming more powerful
at the expense of the bravado of disagreement. If the need for disagreement becomes
too hard to bear, boot up good old YouTube, and comment your anger away, as I think
everyone else does these days :)

Are you the type of person that is good at learning new things? What is the maximum
amount that you can agree with what I'm saying? Think about how much you have
actually used or changed based on all the books you have read in your life. Do you
think that you should get more out of them? What could you do to get the most out of
this book for yourself?

Smarts are genetic

If mental illeness can be inherited, why not mental wellness, or superiority? Shizophrenia
has about 80% concordance amongst twins, but it was once thought to be bad parenting.

IQ

Kinetic ability vs potential ability (should reduce the fear/hatred of differences in IQ):
People overestimate the value of Intelligence in comparison to motivation, delayed
gratification. How many people do you living up to their potential? Is it because they don't
know what to do, or because they won't do what they should? If the difference in results is
traction, not horsepower, then don't worry so much about someone's bigger or smaller
motor.

Cascading advantage:

People underestimate the value of small changes in some types of intelligence. They
cascade. If you learn how to learn faster, or better, it cascades across all the new learning.
Imagine a bookshelf vs a stack of books. Some people develop tricks early on that are the
shelves. Hit a golf ball a little crooked and see how crooked it ends up 100 yards away.

Different is better:

This social programming to search for equality amongst men ignores the value of evolution,
competition, meritocracy, and the resultant emergent fitness and excellence that results.
Different, sometimes better, sometimes worse, is a requirement for robustness and
progress.

Measure mental ability more like physical ability. Look at the detail measured in the nfl
combine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL Scouting Combine

When you create an IQ test, you use specific stratagies to avoid cultural bias, and measure
useful traits, like memory, speed, visualization, rotating objects in ones mind, etc. Why not
just declare the results by category. The test maker knew what he was measuring. There's
no reason to mush it all together.

Intro

Intro

You do less than you could, and know more than you need. What happens to those who
exercise and eat well? They become fit. Are you fit?

If you're unfit, is it due to a lack of knowledge? Any exercise works, any diet works. Eat less,
move more. It's certainly not the knowledge that is the problem. Millions of men choose to
learn instead of do, and they die quite unaccomplished and smart. This is the quiet
desperation of the intelligent. Be smart, even wise; but only as a means, not an end.


Knowing isn't doing and knowledge isn't action. What you need isn't more know-how, but
more desire. If the world were to transform to one where everyone did what they thought
they should, then it'd need more know-how. While you live in a world where almost no one
does all the things they think they should, you have more a discipline problem than a
knowledge problem.









Would you rather have your cake, or eat it? There's a similar challenge choosing between
knowing how to do something, and actually doing it. They're related, but quite different in
practice. That's why great sports players learn from coaches that can't play better than they
can. Knowing and doing are different, yet related.


Grow your mind with action as a guide. Adding to the list of things you know you should do,


but do not, is pain. The value of knowledge comes only from application.

Perception, attention, lense, focus, paradigm

Focus control / attention economy, have high standards for what you pay attention to!

Back in the good ole days, it was very hard to find information. Now it's too easy to
find information. We went from having to meet with people physically, to being able
to speak to them over a distance on the phone, to email, to texting, and now you
rarely need to speak to the person and ask them a question because we have
Wikipedia, YouTube videos, blogs, Twitter. We are drowning in content. There's lots
more signal to be had, and there's lots more noise, too. Since the signal is always
lower in quantity than the noise, if you have good standards for what you should be
paying attention to, it's not distraction, clickbait, and social proof.




Every day that passes the amount of bad content and wrong ideas is created more
and faster and more convincingly than good content and right ideas. Since they put
less time into building good ideas, they have extra time to figure out how to sell the
bad ideas better. Now that's a tragedy. Those with the best ideas are too busy
building them to market them. Marketing of ideas and building of ideas are wildly
different, except in one area. The building of marketing / communication / influence
ideas. It’s self-referential and amplifying. All the other ideas aren't.

Lens of Scivivalism- What you look at affects how you feel, don't focus on the suck

What you look at affects how you feel. If you grew up around people that are shitty
and what you learn is shitty behaviors, then you end up being shitty with a higher
likelihood. If you look at the suck in the world, that suck will rub off on you to some
degree and you will feel the suck. At any given moment there's an infinite amount of
good and bad things going on, and the feelings that you will feel and your perception
of the world will be what you focus on.

I found it to be a good shortcut for understanding that by imagining yourself as a
crystal, either a cool-looking shard of crystal or crystal figurine, like a bear, that your
eyes would accept the light of what you looked at. If you tuned into and looked at a
pretty light that was beautiful, say a white light or a blue light, that's what you would
radiate, that's what you would feel when other people look at you. They would see
the light that you are focusing on. If there was some other shitty thing going on the
world and that is what you focused on, then that is what you would feel and you
wouldn't just feel it, you would also re-transmit it, radiate it and become that color.
Therefore, you become what you focus on and you become good at what you do. You
appear to others to be what it is that you focus on and what it is that you do.

Thus, that analogy of the energy of what you look at changing your body, I thought
was really well transmitted by the light and crystal analogy. Additionally, when you
think about the way that a prism divides a white light into its separate colors and
wavelengths, and that if you were to re-combine those colors and wavelengths once
again, you would get white light on the other side. That's balanced. As soon as you're
missing one of those wavelengths, you no longer are able to recreate white light
again, because you're missing one of the components you need.

Don't focus on problems, instead rephrase in a positive light
If you focus on problems, you get more problems.

Positive Rephrasing is important: Focus on what you don't want only for a short time.
Which do you think is a shorter path to fitness, understanding losing, or
understanding winning? Positive phrasing is super important. If you want to be
fit, focus on fitness. You're going to hear this theme a lot. Focus on what you
don't want literally only as long as it takes to invert it, and create the positive
understanding and language of what you DO want. Maybe I tell you to not
imagine a giant neon pink elephant right now, drinking some chocolate milk.

Did you not imagine it? If you think about not being fat, you'll think about being
fat and eating fattening foods. If you take the time to invert it, and you think
about being fit, you've made your life so very, very much easier.

Understanding your perception through senses

Not only are you different from how you used to be, your vision changes, your taste
changes, but you are different from how you currently are, too.



To explain, what I mean is that for instance, music, there's something called the
Fletcher-Munson curves, which means that your hearing changes entirely based on
how loud or not loud a sound is. For instance, it is widely accepted that you should
master music with a reference volume of 75 to 85 dB because that's where hearing is
most linear.

Thus, unless you have a calibrated decibel meter with you, it's very hard to tell just by
listening how loud a sound actually is. This means that without you realizing that your
hearing itself changes its perception based on how loud or not loud a sound is, I
wouldn't be surprised if similar kinds of changes based on brightness existed for
seeing as well.

As far as knowing what the real world looks like, we're stuck in a pretty funny spot -
we not only have all these lossy perceptions, but our brains also are susceptible to
shortcuts that make us more effective some of the time, of being less effective other
times. For instance, you always see your nose, it's always there, but you just never
notice it, and the same thing goes for blinking. You never really notice your eyes
blinking, even though it's literally making you blind in both eyes for a moment.

Then there are things like infrared, which we can't see, but machines and animals can.
This means that they can actually see temperature. There are even animals that can
see polarized light, which helps them hunt, and it helps us recover erased and hidden
writing in ancient documents or crime scenes.

Point being, if current you is so different from past you, and current you will hear the
different sounds in the same song differently based on whether it's a little louder or a
little less loud, then how the hell could you expect another human being, in their past
or present, to detect the real world similarly to how you view it?

You can avoid lots of arguments by just understanding that when you see dark blue
and someone else sees purple, it might be they chose to deploy the words differently,
or it could be that they really do see the color differently, and are judging it the same,
but off a different input value to their brain.

I know that one of my eyes sees sharper than the other, and I know that they both see
color slightly differently, in that one is a more red tint and one is a more blue tint, or
as they'd say in the color correcting business, one is warmer and one is cooler.

This also applies to people that color calibrate photos, monitors, display devices,
movies and films. They adjust their brightness to a reference level, usually 120 cd/m,
but as you learned earlier, it's very hard to know what that light level actually equals
to in their brains. Some standard, however, is better than no standard. Standards are
the language that the world speaks in, that makes interoperability and communication
possible. I guess you could say standards are the cooperative language of non¬
humans.



Thus, know that your perception of the world is probably very different than everyone
else's, sometimes for good reasons, and sometimes for not so good reasons.
Therefore, you shouldn't waste too much time arguing over perception if you can
avoid it. You can use some tricks to figure out how a person's perception actually
works, for them. That's how we build vision correcting lenses for contacts and seeing
eye glasses. We can look at their eye and make a pretty good guess based on the
shape to measure what kind of lens they will need to make their vision better. It’s not
always perfect though, so what many people end up doing for better results is testing
a whole bunch of different lenses and answering the question, which is better, "this or
this", "this or this".

Now even that is a funny experience as well, because once again, people don't
understand the decisions that are being made. Based on how you change the red and
green color questions, you will affect your color perception. Because if you're
correcting for an astigmatism, you have to choose a middle ground of correction, you
can't perfectly correct both the wavelengths with the same glass. You affect how you
see vertical and horizontal lines differently, then on top of all of that, the lens works
better when it's smaller, closer to the eye, and made of a glass that has a higher abbe
value.

How many people know that their vision correcting glasses made all these tradeoffs,
and that they can have better and worse color and contrast perception based on the
material and coatings that their lenses have? What a complex world we live in.

What we think we perceive is so very often not what we actually perceive. Hard to
make good decisions when you have bad data.

Set your brain for well-roundedness

If you have your brain set for well-roundedness and you're able to execute pretty
awesomely in all areas, it's also very likely that you're not going to be an idiot savant.
It's very likely that it's going to be harder for you to produce levels of excellence
intellectually in a very advanced intellectual field in regards to those people that don't
have the overhead of an honest and good life and a brain that works well socially.
Social understanding and social excellence is actually quite advanced.

Vision

You can make people think your website is loading faster than it really is by changing

Our eyes evolved to sense the natural environment that's most useful to us.

What's trying to eat us, and what are we trying to eat? This is why we see
greens better than blues. Much more of the land we live on and eat from is
green. As a matter of fact, we see blue so poorly, they often encode less of it in
our videos, and display it using less pixels, because we see it with such lower
resolution. Of our 6 to 7 million cones, we've got 64% "red" cones, 32% "green"
and , only 2% "blue."

From < http://hyperphvsics.phv-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/rodcone.html >




Different vantage points (birds move their heads around, to see more of the world,
like a sampling rate, and so we have emotions which cause us to move our heads
around as well, like blurriness causes us to squint.)

(this is spirtual understanding regarding emotional programming, and how you can
better influence others.) Why are some color combinations pretty?

We didn't just evolve physically to see different colors better than others, we
also evolved to prefer certain colors in combination with other colors. Some
colors look great together, and some look very bad together.

If a color combination is only activating one of our three cones, it would make
sense for us to respond emotionally and try and change our vantage point to
see if we could get more light, or a better perspective on what we were looking
at to engage the other cones. In some cases, poisonous creatures have also
chosen red and yellow to signify that they are poisonous, and will harm or kill
you.

There's a fancy name for colorful warnings in animals:

Aposematism

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism >

Mutants exist!

Interestingly, a very small group of people have 4! Xx see tetrachromy))


If you take a look at the color wheel, many of the prettiest combinations are at
opposite sides of the color wheel. That's because they engage more of the I.



We like color combinations that are on opposites to each other on the color
wheel because they provide maximum contrast, and engage the most color
sensing cones in our eyes (Xx missing)

The reason our brains naturally care about colors that are on opposite ends of
the color spectrum, is because we know that we have the best idea of seeing
what's there, because there's no other contrast that can show an edge because
the edges are already shown by the maximum contrast.

Knowledge

Ignorance

We need more why's. Because without the why, if you don't have a glood why, you
shouldn't be teaching that shit. If you can't teach a kid why something is important,
it's actually not important. You should stop teaching it.

It's amazing how little we know, like what's on the other side of the wall from where
you are right now? Like, what is in your neighbor's house after all?

Education

We don't need smarter losers, we need stupider ass-kickers. We need to trade
education for motivation.

If it's true that the world doesn't have a knowledge problem, it has a doing shit
problem, then isn't it funny that what everyone values is a college education which
only makes you smarter, not more effective, not more productive, not hungrier, not
with higher standards, just smarter. We don't need smarter people, we need people
that use more of what they already know.

Economy of learning







Learn the minimum you need to learn to get the job done. The things you need to
know to get a good thing done is going to be a very very very very very small set of all
the things you could possibly know. That means that you're almost always better of
restricting what you learn to what you actually need to know for something you're
doing, than you are trying to overlearn and hope that there's a good collision between
what you learned, and what you actually needed to learn. If you knew how much
doctors used google to search for your symptoms, you'd understand that even
overtraining doesn't keep you from still having to learn specifically about the problem
at hand. Overtraining is the enemy in a fast moving world. You will usually learn
much more from applying what you've learned in the real world than just reading
about it anyway.

Knowing facts doesn't mean you're intelligent

What you know, and your ability to use what you know are only loosely related. This
means you could learn lots of facts and have no idea what to do with them, or you
could be super intelligent, but not know enough about the real world to find any place
good to apply that power.

Car Mind analogy

Knowing this is the fuel for your engine. Intelligence is your engine. Just as a real
engine smashes and explodes fuel to create motion, heat, and power, so too
does your mind smash together ideas to create new and better ideas and
actions.

Knowledge is what you know. Intelligence is how well you can understand and
manipulate what know. You can increase either of them, however, you'll find that
knowledge is greatly easier to increase than intelligence. It's easier to walk for longer
than it is to run faster. You can always walk twice as long, at some point you can't run
twice as fast.

Know thyself. Are you the light or the dark?

If you can't get better answers to hard questions than others, then you probably
shouldn't be influencing others. You're not the light shining in the dark, you're more of
the dark. If you want to get things right where everyone else gets them wrong, then
it's really handy to know what common things most people screw up, so you can avoid
those traps yourself.

Knowing what you know

Just smart enough to be dangerous

The uncanny valley of true knowledge.

When you don't know how complicated the world is, and you present
simple solutions for complex problems, you get to discover the hard way
why those solutions were bad ideas.

If you think the world is a simple place, and you understand that
simplicity, then you have the contentment that can come with ignorance.

If you realize the world is a complicated place, you can become fearful
and worried that you don't understand it well enough, even though you're
better equipped to perform in it than the content and ignorant man. That
is the uncanny valley of understanding the world.

Simpler ideas are often more useful

Seems like the smartest people feel obligated to read things that they feel are at the
edge of their understanding, so they can feel like they're growing. The problem is that



if you're one of the smartest people, that shit at the edge of your understanding isn't
really useful to most other people. It's quite often that people stupider than the
smartest are much more useful to the general public, because the shit that they study
is within the realm of understanding of the common man.

Knowledge is asymmetrical

Knowledge asymmetry example

At night the person on the dark side of the window can see the other side fine.
The person on the brighter other side can't see shit. When you're dealing with
noise, the person on the loud side you can't hear shit, but the person on the
quiet inside can hear it just fine. That's why if you're in the attic working, no one
can hear you, but you can hear everybody. When you're in the shower, you
can't hear anything but everyone can hear you.

Isn't it cool that there's a strong and weak position for both light, sound, and
actual knowledge? It would be great to always know whether you were on the
weak or strong side, before you started making decisions, for instance trading a
market, or negotiating.

Learning tricks

Peak state and staying engaged while learning
Motion is emotion

Peak state practice and Tony Robbins' "Date with Destiny"

The best event or seminar that you can attend in the world, that I'm
aware of, is Anthony Robbins' "Date with Destiny". It's expensive, about
five thousand dollars, it happens over, I believe, five days, and they don't
tell you this when you sign up, but those five days are going to be 16 hour
days. Now, you may ask yourself, how on earth do you keep a bunch of
rather old, rather plump executives and other types, that have five grand
to blow on a seminar, a couple times a year, and very specific places that
you have to travel to and pay for your accommodation, how do you get
those people to stay engaged and learning and happy about the
experience for 16 hours? The solution is, depending on how you want to
frame it, really, really awesome and amazing, because it works, or rather
disappointing, because it's so goddamn simple that you would think that it
shouldn't work. Basically, the magic is you stand up, you jump up and
down for joy, and are genuinely happy and dance to fancy music and
massage the people around you, and do shit that seems totally alien in the
muted, static, non-moving world that we're used to these days. If you
were to look to when you were younger, when you were a kid, or, if you
see kids in the mall, they're running. I'm not sure at what age the running
stops, but the kids love to run, and climb, and jump, and search, and then
sometime between then and where we are now, that shit dies and we get
scared, and we're like "No, I don't want to act any different, people might
notice me."

So, does it work? A hundred percent. Do I want to actually do it to
demonstrate it? No, because I'm not used to doing it, but I'm going to,
because in this life you only get the results of that what you will actually
do, knowing about shit doesn't matter so much, doing the shit matters


much more unless you're so very lucky to be a coach or someone that can
influence the world through, you know, mass media. If it's anything that
you or the people that you interact with is actually going to benefit from,
it is very, very, very likely that it is something that you're actually going to
need to do, and not know about.

Learning through games
Chess

Being good at chess has very little value outside of chess. Knowing to cut
off escapes before you move in for the kill, leave options open with forks,
value tempo and position, know that some things can be sacrificed for
position or speed, and realizing that different tools excel at different
things. That's about it, and I'm being generous. Those lessons aren't even
obvious, and I'm not sure you'd learn them without just being straight up
told them. Learning logic is much, much better than learning chess.

Information sources

Be careful who you take advice from

It's funny, if you ever learned neuro-linguistic programming, NLP, one of the
cofounders of the system is Richard Bandler, and Richard Bandler has been fat
for as long as that system has existed. I've never seen Richard not fat, nor have I
seen him not smoking. Maybe he kicked the smoking, but he has spent a
lifetime fat though. To the intelligent person, you have to be careful to take
investment advice and life advice from homeless people, and you have to be
careful in taking personal development advice from people who are fat and
smoke, and have done so for a very long time, yet advertise they have the cures
to these very things, and that the cures are fast, painless and take nearly no
effort on your part to execute. If that was the case, then why wouldn't the
person or his partner have accidentally cured them of that obviously stupid shit
by now?

Forums

There appears to be a distribution of quality of comments, at the very
beginning, and just before the very end, I'd say at the 1 percent complete, and
85-90 percent complete positions in the thread. This would make sense, for
threads that you see, are most likely to be on the front page. Threads on the
front page are those that were most recently posted in. As threads get older,
and things get figured out, they become less interesting, and thus get
commented on less, which makes them less likely to be on the front page. This
makes them less likely to get commented on again, and the info, and problem
may have already been solved, or replaced by more interesting problems.

Thus, you know to look at first page, and 85 to 90 area of the thread. To show
you the negative space, the final posts are almost always the worst, speaking
only to trivia or tidbits that is relevant to the least number of people, for if it
were relevant or interesting, it would get bumped down to the 85, to 90 area
with responses. By definition, the fact that the comments were last, means they
weren't worth responding to, thus they're likely to be of lower quality.



Identifying good sources of knowledge in forums
Forums, cutting through the bullshit

Forums and mailing lists are likely to get worse over time, so you
may have to find new sources of good information as their signal to
noise ration deteriorates - idea density. Some sources of
information have very high signal to noise. Parables and the laws of
nature are very useful in minimum words.

Flit the sweet parts

There appears to be a distribution of quality of comments at
the very beginning, and just before the very end. The first
post usually gets updated with the most important things. I'd
say, at the 1 percent complete, and 85-90 percent complete
positions in the thread. This would make sense, for threads
that you see, are most likely to be on the front page. Threads
on the front page are those that were most recently posted
in. As threads get older, and things get figured out, they
become less interesting, and thus get commented on less,
which makes them less likely to be on the front page, which
makes them less likely to get commented on again, and the
info, and problem may have already been solved, or replaced
by more interesting problems.

Thus, now you know to look at first page, and 85 to 90 area of
the thread

Skip the bullshit

The final posts are almost always the worst, speaking
only to trivia or tidbits that is relevant to the least
number of people, for if it were relevant or interesting,
it would get bumped down to the 85, to 90 area with
responses. By definition, the fact that the comments
were last, means they weren't worth responding to,
thus they're likely to be of lower quality.


Calling out Idiots

Every time you see two people disagreeing on TV, if you wait a few years, and
go back, you can probably tell which one of them was a dumb ass and wrong. It

this dumb ass was channel.

The Unbearable Asymmetry of Bullshit

http://quillette.com/2Q16/02/15/the-unbearable-asymmetrv-of-bullshit/

What is knowledge? Know the right things

The usefulness of knowing the difference between intelligence and knowledge is
mostly to get you to stop wasting your time and focus on things that matter
instead of sitting out thinking you're smart, while you're beating your peers at
all the wrong things. You know sports better than your friend? You have failed.
You are better at last year's video game that no one plays anymore? You have
failed. You have put thousands of hours into Donkey Kong to be the king of
Kong? Congratulations, you're are the biggest fish in the smallest toilet bowl.
Difference between intelligence and knowledge

When looking at the mind, one way to understand the difference between
intelligence and knowledge is the way a computer does. You have a CPU that
does all the processing, that's why it's called the central processing unit. It's only
as useful as your ability to feed it work to process. Knowledge is your memory,
and much like your computer has long-term and short-term memory (hard
drives are long-term and ram is short-term.) A computer with no memory is
pretty useless. A very intelligent man deprived of things to learn is equally
tragic.

Mental tactics, don't waste your consciousness on probability

I need to finish a play on words, which is nature abhors a vacuum and I think it would
be funnier to say nature loves filling a vacuum up with useless shit - because it's more
accurate. It's not like the vacuum gets filled with stuff that was useful. Step two,
whenever you learn cool new information, you can't go too deep on the rabbit hole
for information, it's too long and too far out, you'll just die with the information and
the trough of disillusionment.


You're better off not learning what's going to be coming out one day. You easily waste
your consciousness focusing on probabilities that are unlikely. You should really focus
on the things that have already actually happened and are just coming out of their
trough of disillusionment. The summary of this text would be mental tactic for
knowledge. Skip the trough of disillusionment and it's also Betteridge's law of
headlines - if any headline asks a question, the answer is always no.

Eponymous laws - build on the communication of great ideas

Modern discoveries are often named after those who popularized an idea. Back when
our understanding of the world was much less accurate, some men made such great
contributions of so many ideas that have never been seen, that you couldn't name any
one thing they came up with at "their name's law", because they had a bunch of other
great discoveries as well. These days for any given person to have more than a couple
laws named after him is rather rare. This is partly because it's harder now than ever
before to make tons of contributions, for the same reason it's easier to make a single
one, information sharing. Back then if you were working on a hard problem, you might
very well be the only person on the planet doing so, for communication was slow and
inefficient. Now the same communication that brings you great ideas to build on, is
the same communication that creates a leveling effect against your ability to
massively produce ideas in series without someone else "stealing your thunder" and
making great progress on what you've made known.


This is better for the world in a lot of ways. First, we all build on the backs of giants,
and so must we offer the improved ideas we build to those that come after us to










stand on as well. It's easier to remember these laws, because they all have unique
names. How easy is it to remember the Streisand effect, when you know the story of
her trying to remove pictures of her house from the Internet, which angered the
Internet, and when the Internet is angry, spreading data is what it does best. Needless
to say, what few people would ever care to know about became quite important, for
only the fact she wanted it hidden. It's insanely likely that the idea of drawing
unwanted attention to a small thing by trying to hide it and getting caught was well
known long before the Barbara Streisand incident, however, it was never so easy to
remember previously.

That's what's great about a law. Ideas are only as useful to us as we remember that
they even exist, and when they should be used. It's even better if you know how to
use them accurately. Knowing is half the battle, they say.

Some of these laws are really interesting. If you hope to add to the world's
understanding of complicated things, you too should hope to phrase an understanding
so well, that it becomes a law named after you. This idea of naming things after
inventors applies in more places than just ideas.

Displaying strength - learn from other animal's success

If paying attention to what works in the world that we live in is an effective strategy
for discovering what works, which is tautological, the important educational point
there is that by seeing what works for other creatures and in nature, you can kind of
extend that discovery into other areas. If you see in the animal kingdom that strength
gets chosen a lot more often than weakness, it could be very likely that in your life,
and in most other people's lives, displaying strength pays off a lot better than
displaying weakness. The point here is that by understanding some parts of life, no
matter what they are, if you're intelligent, you can usually learn something
unexpected about other parts of life, because lots of things in life are related.
Acquisition: How, when, why, where

Mission should not be to get the best of logic

You see all these super smart super logical people that disagree about things. If
they disagree about things, that means one of them is wrong, which means that
one of those two super genius, super smart, super logical people is horribly
wrong. In this case, the other one's right, or, they're both wrong. It is possible,
though very unlikely, that they have misread the question and they're both
right. Your mission in life shouldn't be to get the best of logic unless you want to
add to the science or teach people logic. If you want to lead a good and
wholesome life, you don't actually need that much. Logic and the logic you need
isn't that complicated. It seems like if you go farther into that rabbit hole and
farther into the complicating anything that you might learn, you won't be able
to benefit from, because you don't have the horsepower and the time to
properly apply it and know when to apply it.




If you spend all day building tools instead of using tools, you're a good tool
builder. It doesn't mean that you're good at using the tools.

I don't want you to believe that getting smarter is the best thing that you can
do. I don't want you to believe that understanding logic the best is the best
thing you can do. This is because in my research, looking at the past of all the
other human beings that have ever existed, those that you would be most likely
to trade places with, if you could be convinced to do so, or those that you
respect the most are almost never the best at the thing that they did. They
might be quite good, they might be top ten percent, top two percent, but
they're almost never the best, because to truly be the best at a thing, you've got
to make a load of sacrifices in other places in your life and endure pain to overly
push out in that one singular direction that one singular focus.

You probably only see the upside and not all the sacrifice, pain, sleepless nights
and lost friendships, because it's not well marketed to you and no one is making
any money selling you that idea.

Your perception of how fun, pleasurable and what you get out of other ways of
living than the way that you currently have, is heavily weighted towards it being
a lot better than it really is. No one finds profit in telling you the truth that
everyone that has done a hard thing that other people have tried and failed.
Knowing that being the smartest and the most logical is not your aim, it's not
your goal and that you'll probably endure a lot of pain from not being well
rounded. Both success and failure leave clues. If you do the same things that
people that failed did, you're likely to fail. If you do things that winners do,
you're likely to win. Highest and best behavior is hard to measure because best
is very subjective. What's the best color for instance? Judging highest is much
easier than judging best. When everyone learns the same shit, it becomes
valueless.

We have an entire culture of people going massively in debt to waste their time
learning things they can never use. Because value is indirectly proportional to
availability, since everyone's learning the same shit, it's all infinitely valueless.
It's the same reason you can't make money as a photographer because people
do it for free. It's hard to make money as a musician because people do it for
free. If you do want to make money in this world, you've got to do what other
people don't want to do and can't do, so they're willing to up the ante and pay
you a little bit more to do it. Learning what everyone else does, thus by
definition of value, the least scarce knowledge is therefore the least valuable.

Don't be a weak robot, do what Google cannot do!

Richard Feynman had a great talk on this in regards to a conversation that he
had with his father. They were in the Boy Scouts and they would go off into the
mountains and hike alone, and the other boys wanted to come along because
his father was such a great person to talk to, learn from and be educated by. He
was a well-rounded thinker, and he really valued his alone time with his son and
wanted it to be more personal, more of a family thing. While the other kids
would go out to the woods and learn what all the birds were called, Richard



Feynman's father said that what that bird is called is the least important thing
about the bird. Let's learn everything else other than what the bird is called,
because we could learn what that bird is called in ten or fifteen different
languages. After you know the fifteen different names for the bird, you now
know nothing about the bird. What does it eat? Why does it make the sounds
that it makes? Where does it travel? Is there an altitude that it likes? How long
does it live? How educated is it? Can you make it smarter? Everything that is
useful to know about the bird is basically outside the set of names that it's
called.

Do what Google can't. Things you know that you aren't using, replace with
synthesis and higher level understanding. If you want to be a crazy Google,
please instead learn to do what Google cannot. Being good at Google is better
than memory. Memory tricks are the easiest to teach and learn, unfortunately
having a great memory is pretty useless these days. Being good at googling is
better than having a great memory. The crappiest pencil is better than the best
memory.

Techniques

When to acquire more information and how much

There should be a word for not learning about the difference between things
and comparing the ratio of the range of variants and the quality that can be
obtained if you have extra information, versus the range of time that you can
spend learning about making that decision properly. If someone hasn't invented
that concept of that idea, I should. The decision is to whether you should
continue to inquire information or not is the range of quality divided by the
range of time that it would take to learn to get the quality.

Ultimate Knowledge of a thing sometimes defeats the purpose of the thing

In life, some things need to be kept secret to work. If you go to see a comedy
show, they don't tell you how they design the joke and how the joke has
evolved over time, which versions of it didn't work and which timings of delivery
worked, what kind of response you are waiting for from the audience before
you go to this thing. If they told you, any of that shit it wouldn't be funny.
Ultimate knowledge of a thing sometimes defeats the purpose of the thing. It's
like watching a film after you've studied filmmaking; You can never see films the
same again because you are always looking to the motives and intentions of the
director.

Having just enough knowledge to be dangerous - being a dilettante

Now, you can just use that knowledge to support whatever you were
going to support anyway. Oh, I think you should get better sleep because
of serotonin reuptake, or aliens, or vibrations, and crystals, and global
feeling stuff. It's literally appeal to ignorance. However, you don't know
you're ignorant, which makes it a different thing. Knowing enough to be
dangerous is how people get electrocuted replacing their blown fuses
with aluminum bars.

The good news is that people misunderstand most things. How long does
it take to break when you're going extremely fast on the highway? Or how
hard it is to turn a motorcycle when you're going extremely fast and when



you start breaking? You can't turn anymore because it brings the bike
upright. You don't realize those until you're already dying. You don't
realize that you should not be messing around in your electrical panel
until you're already dying. It's good that the rest of the world isn't that
way. Maybe you take too much of Vitamin B, maybe you get a headache
or something. Worst case scenario is a headache, but take aspirin. You
know, if you don't realize that taking too much aspirin literally kills you.
You might be the kind of guy that thinks that there's not a minimum
affective dose, more is always better and doesn't understand how
medicine works or doesn't understand how the human body works. As a
result, now you're in the hospital, fighting for your life because you had a
really bad headache. You thought just a couple more Aspirin would finally
kick it finally cure it. Now you're dying.

The likelihood that you will benefit from knowing a little bit about a thing
and that ending up with more harm than good is directly proportional to
the complexity of the thing that you're talking about. The more complex
and hard to understand that thing is, the more likely you are to mess it up
and get harm instead of benefit. Knowing enough to be dangerous really
exists in the real world. You can know whether you're getting more likely
to get usefulness or more likely to get pain. Out of a layman's
understanding of a thing, based on the complexity of the thing, you
should probably shut up about super complicated things of which you
might have saw one episode on the Discovery Channel.

Doing beats learning

Who becomes more fit? The man who fills his days reading books on
weightlifting and diet, or the man who reads no such books, but never misses a
morning round of pushups, pull-ups and squats? Learning about fitness is not
fitness. Learning about dance is not dancing. Learning about success is not
success. Unless you are a teacher or author, learning is only as useful as it turns
into action.

Learning by doing

I am of the belief, that there are things that you can learn from doing, and that's
totally useful, and that there are things that you can learn only through
teaching.

Know the difference between the method and the reason

Is what you think you want what you really want, or should want? Could you
want something better? Know the difference between a means and an end.
Don't confuse means for ends. Means is another word for method, or way. For
instance, if you wanted to know what you should eat, most people would be far
better off searching for healthy tasty food, instead of why am I fat.

How to widen your understanding

There was a saying regarding your choices what you do with your career in life,
it's called the Helsinki bus station. The theory of the Helsinki bus station is that
when you come into this world and learn how to speak and to do things, and
specifically, or in this case, if you go to a college, or a high school, that puts you
in the bus station. What you find is that all the buses hit all the stops leaving the



city, and only after a couple stops have passed and you're out of the city do you
start to get differentiation, where you're ending up at stops that all the other
buses weren't ending up at. That divergence, just like a tree, a tree has a trunk
and then it has a crap load of branches. Those branches quite literally sprout out
into space, three dimensionally. Why do they do that? What's the only reason
that branches on a tree do that? Because that's where the light is. The light isn't
where you started, because there's something else already there, absorbing the
light, there's a leaf in the way. Thus, you don't get any light if you stay there.

The education system is the same way. I like this tree idea better, I just invented
it.

I like the tree idea of valuing, staying on the bus long enough to get the hell out
of the city so you can start to get variation and find your unique way to benefit
this world. Maybe your way isn't unique, but you punch so much harder that
you do the same way better. Maybe you got off at one of those earlier stops,
but you're doing it better. If you want to actually have a wide and varied
background, and a wide and varied understanding and ability to do things, the
most poisonous thing you could do is go to the same restricted place, learn the
same restricted things from the same restricted people, for the same restricted
goals. How the fuck do you think that will work out? You're maximizing your
similarity to all those that came before you. How are you supposed to make an
impact and a difference if you started the same place, and then made the same
decisions? It's a terrible way to start. If you're going to go that route, maybe you
stay doing it long enough that you ride the same idea deep enough that you can
actually start to make breakthroughs at the very end. Some things work like
that, some things don't. Some things, no one's working on them. You could be
that guy. Maybe synthetic biology's your thing. Maybe you think bio hacking is
your thing. When they were building Apple in a garage, they weren't in college
learning about how to build Apple. The coolest, most profitable things that have
affected our lives, a lot of them were not designed at the end of a long bus ride.
They were a short bus ride on a path that most people just didn't take.

Act on your knowledge

Knowledge is knowing what to do, a skill you don’t have to win arguments or
teach people. If people aren't going to act on the information anyway, who
cares if they're right or not? Right and wrong are only as useful as action.

GREAT ACTIONABLE TIPS FOR LEARNING

1) Acquire chunks of knowledge and apply them in different settings.

2) Take breaks to improve your memory and your ability to solve problems.

3) Structure your learning. Map out prerequisites, and start with concepts that
you need 80% of the time. Prioritize knowledge that adds genuine, direct value.

4) Learn in differing environments, work with knowledge in differing ways and
use multiple senses.

5) Read other's learning journeys, have mentors, and gain feedback. Work on
your ability to be vulnerable in order to do all of this effectively.

6) Leverage your emotions by making information and problems more engaging.

Learn when you are young! It multiplies over time





Learning is the most affordable when you are young, and has the most value to
multiply over time. It affects your trajectory the most, and your acceleration,
and thus, your end point is maximally influenced. What good would be learning
your times tables on your last day alive?

Improve your learning by deleting non-useful stuff

Delete non-useful (history, astronomy). Insert useful (logic, ethics, mnemonics
(not great but better than history)). If the world has changed over 100 years, but
the learning about it hasn't, you're doing it wrong.

Re-viewing content so you don't miss the benefit

If you're not rewinding the video, or rereading parts of a book, it's very likely
you're letting the data and ideas pass right by you, and you're going to not only
miss out on it, but not even know where to find it again when you discover you
missed it. Good luck figuring out the spots you zoned out during an hour long
video.

Accurate predictions a way of thinking to discover

Learning about the real world, how the real world works and what is likely to
happen in the real world by having a good ability to recognize patterns and
extend them into the future. This is quite similar to knowing the past and
learning from it, and thus being more accurate in your predictions. Even more
advanced, understanding statistics and being able to come up with an estimate
of how likely to be right your prediction is, and what your prediction really
means (false positive paradox, Monty Hall problem, prosecutors fallacy, etc.). It
lets you discover and use a way of thinking that is quite hard to arrive at by
other teachings.

What I have learned as a matter of discovery and usefulness is that you make
much better decisions and are much more aware of what is actually likely to
happen in the future when you just make a grid, and fill it on the top and side
with all the possible things that could happen. It seems like great discoveries can
be made when you skip your brains natural and useful estimations of what is
probably going to happen in a situation, and actually manually chart out all the
possible outcomes you can think of.

You could consider this the brute forcing of a solution to a problem. It's funny,
sometimes you'll be tested on your ability to do some fancy math, and you can
look at the problem intellectually, guess a number that might be close to a
solution for it. Just try sticking in a few answers in that range and discover the
solution faster by just trying some different answers that you think might work,
than it is to try to purely mathematically systematically use the real algebra that
would solve the problem.

This is similar to the statistics learnings in that, if you test positive for a thing,
you don't have any idea how much that means you actually have the thing
unless you know two things. First, how good the test is, and here's the magic.
Second, how common is anyone to have what you're testing for? Then you
multiply them. Better test, more likely, more people have it? Also more likely.
Conversely the less common it is for people to actually have what you are
testing for, and the less accurate your test, then the less and less likely you are



to actually have what you've tested positive for. You must know both things, or
you literally can't know how confident you should be in your test result.

Time value of knowledge

The time value of knowledge can be easy established by trailing indicators. If
you know what the future is going to look like a minute before it happens, you
can trade it and become nearly infinitely wealthy. If, however, your indication as
to the state of world is delayed by a minute, then you'll constantly lose every
trade you make.

A trailing indicator is when you find correlation but you can't make any money
on it. Let's say you got Google Search Volume, Bitcoin price and your using
Google Search Volume for the term Bitcoin and tying it to the chart of Bitcoin's
price. You'll find that when the searches for Bitcoin price go up, the Bitcoin price
goes up and vice versa.

Here's the problem, which one of them comes first? A trailing indicator is
something that cannot predict the future, it's just something that says, Hey, the
future already happened and therefore you don't get to make any money on it.
Looking at a chart of the taxonomy of ideas is a trailing indicator. It goes, I'm
glad that we've got these new ideas that you've taught, put into and order and
made excellent, and now we're going to analyze those ideas using this
framework that can just analyze what already exists between and cannot
whatsoever be used to generate anything new.

Sometimes the organization of ideas into a chart will allow you to understand
what already exists better, but will confuse you and make impossible the
generation of any new thing.

Time value of knowledge and optional knowledge

Optional, not just because you don't need to know it now, but because like
options in the real world, you pay for them. If you buy an option and learn
something you don't need to know, you will have paid for that option. If you use
the data, the option paid off. If you don't use the data, you lost the time and
effort of learning the depreciating in value knowledge, at the expense of other
knowings you might have been able to act on.

Depreciating technical knowledge / false intelligence

The fallacy that being good at chess makes you good at anything else
https://medium.com/message/whv-chess-will-destrov-your-mind-

78adl034521f

Educate yourself just before the task at hand

Learn what you need to know right before you're going to do it. If you learn
something before you're going to act on it, the landscape may have changed
and you might have to relearn it all again, wasting your time. This is especially
true for techical issues, for they are improved so rapidly.

Consensus on who the experts are, by other experts, especially across disciplines
Expert by consensus of winners

If Tony Robbins and Tim Ferriss, along with some other pretty
resepectable dudes both take time out of their well curated books to
speak well of the same other expert, then it's likely that expert is worth
looking into.




Amazingly useful and dense sources of knowledge

The stickled threads in forums and discussion forums in general

The stickied posts in subreddits on right bar

Infographics

Wikis (can be dangerous if you browse too wide or deep, must maintain focus
control and choose not to learn lots.)

FAQ's (some are too bloated.)

RTFM ( Read The Fucking Manual)

Hackernews

I leave this last, because the reason it's the last bastion of intelligent
discussion out there.

Decay of communities over time

Puns, quips, jokes, off-topic posts, trolling, all these things amplify when
there’s an audience that rewards them. It’s self-referential, as you get the
first troll, he will interact with new trolls, thus trolls beget trolls, and jokes
beget jokes.

The places I’ve found with the densest, most useful information mineable places

Quotes and parables

Curiosity pays great dividends

Curious people get really smart. By definition, we must learn about the topic in
question, and we care about it, so well watch a 2-hour video about the boring
to everyone else thing, because to use, we must to fulfill our curiosity. The
upside is that you can go deeper than most people, and find happiness easier
with this giant world of cool new things. The downside is you can get locked
down random paths of depreciating knowledge, or trivia, at the cost of your
productivity. There’s an art to knowing when to learn, what to learn, and when
to attack.

People love to think that there’s value in things that they don't understand,
which is a useful disbelief, because it amplifies the desire to understand that
which you don’t. Curiosity pays great dividends. When I see something, and I
don’t understand it, I want to understand it. Not even because I think that
there’s great value in understanding it, it may be something stupid and trivial,
but because I take pride in understanding things for the sake of understanding
them, even if they're a waste of time.



Being curious and learning about cool shit, recognizing new patterns and ways
things are done, things that can exist and how they can exist in their forms
amplifies the speed and quality in which you can generate new forms, styles,
beliefs and strategies and recognize or create patterns that other people
couldn't, even if those actual individual things sucked. Curiosity is a much better
way to waste time, and experimenting and tinkering is a much better way to
waste time than say, mindless trance inducing techniques, which destroy
consciousness. Or, you know, drugging yourself into a coma.

I believe people sometimes fall afoul over over-assigning important things that
they do not understand into pseudo-science, and into pseudo discovery. Just
because you don't understand it, or it seems complicated doesn't mean that it is
good or right. Just because you read a religious text that is complicated as fuck
and doesn't make any sense, because it is poorly written, has no frequently
asked questions and has no table of contents, it wasn't written in a language
that you speak, hasn't been updated in thousands of years, and has conflicting
fucking translations, it may seem important to you, because you do not
understand it, because it sucks. Similar to other things that you don't
understand that do actually have value, you are blindly assigning importance to
a complicated thing where truthfully, the stuff is not accurate and it will do
more harm than good. If you accidentally assign factual truth to fiction, then
you will build your world view and your ability to make better, faster, smarter
decisions in the future on inaccurate realities that never actually existed.
Therefore, you have optimized your world that doesn't, hasn't and will never
exist.

Best knowledge usually found with unquenchable thirst

The best knowledge can't be read. You must beat it out of the world with your
unquenchable thirst. Science and research teaches you things that no one has
ever known before in the history in the world. Playing catchup isn't going to
make you rich.

Discover and learn by doing what works

Many great discoveries are made by accident. Many great inventors come out of
liberal non-technical arts educations. Lots of people find money laying in the
street. Who gives a fuck? You can either do what you know leads to an
outcome, or fuck around and try everything but that, and see what gets you
there faster. Try walking home by going every direction but home, and I think
you'll figure out which one works better.

If you can't find the knowledge you seek, you may need to create and discover it
yourself.

General ideas you can try new places
Pushing-pulling effect

There's an efficiency of stairs over ramps. You'll notice that stairs also take

more material, and I think that an analogy can be made between how



most multicellular living organisms appear to operate with a structure of
hard surfaces and polling services, so basically tension.

You have hard things, which basically take no effort at all to resist
compression, it's just their natural form. Then you have tendons and
muscles that do the soft pulling stuff. It's just an interesting concept that
in effect, like when you stand up, you're not really using that much
energy, because you've just got things balanced right. You're taking
advantage of non-compressing properties of bone. That makes you
wonder where else in the world we should see a similar pushing-pulling
opposite effect. Maybe you could say it's concrete and rebar, because
rebar resists the pulling and concrete resist the pushing.

Cross polinational discovery

The use of the word accident to describe scientific breakthroughs and
discoveries that happened in a lab while you were looking for a different thing is
kind of a waste of the term accident. The term accident that people are used to
is an accidental thing that occurred that you weren't expecting. However, if
you're in a material science lab and you find a new material that does some
weird shit, you were in the lab. You put in a couple $100K of equipment, $100K
of dudes, $100K of education, you got a half a million dollars sitting there trying
to make discoveries, and you just happened to discover something different.
That's not a fucking accident. If you're flipping burgers at Burger King, you're
not discovering shit. I think a new word should be invented for the cross¬
pollination, cross-jurisdictional, sideways discovery of something in a discovery
palace called a lab.

Knowing the difference between a test and an experiment

It’s important to understand what I believe the difference between experiments
and testers. If you test something, you have a very reasonable expectation of
what passing and failing looks like. As a person grading the test you learn very
little. If I give you a multiple choice test and you do well, I learn basically nothing
other than how well you did on the test. If I give you a slightly different test,
which is much more subjective in its grading, if I tell you to write me a ten page
essay on the most important problem in the world, now I'm not only going to
learn what you have decided to choose as the most important problem in the
world, but I also might learn something about that which you have written
about.

Knowing the difference between a test and an experiment is that it's a lot easier
to learn from experiments, because you aren't sure of what the range of
possible solutions is, and you're trying to perform learning as your goal. I'm
doing this experiment, I want to see what happens. That's why it's an
experiment, let's see what happens. I think that a useful definition of the
difference between a test and an experiment is your intention as to whether
you're trying to learn something or whether you're just trying to give someone
else a great thing that makes a big difference and separate from your tension.
How wide is the possible solution set? When you do an experiment, the range of
solutions that you would accept as proper outputs is all of them, assuming you



performed a good experiment, didn't screw it up. When you give a test the
range of solutions that you would be comfortable with receiving, they are very
specific.

I think the most important thing you can learn from knowing the difference
between a test and an experiment is that you're going to learn a lot more from
being open-minded, experimenting and looking for learning and building on
discoveries that were unexpected. You're going to get more out of experiments
than you're out of tests. There's probably little else that you could do to learn
less from another party than give them a multiple choice test. How are you
going to learn from that? What are you going to learn? Not much.

We have the most powerful knowledge finding tool the world has ever seen
instantly and freely available to us. What a great time to be alive! If all the
knowledge of the world is nearly free, then how can you secure advantage for
yourself over your competitors in this world of limited resources? By being able
to find better knowledge than they can, faster than they can. Enter the Google-
fu. Why wouldn't the most powerful search tool on the planet have some bad

Teach kids how to Google


Symbol

How to use it

+

Search for Google+ pages or blood types

Examples: +Chrome or AB+

@

Find social tags

Example: @agoogler

$

Find prices

Example: Nikon $400

#

Find popular hashtags for trending topics

Example: #throwbackthursday


When you use a dash before a word or site, it
excludes sites with that info from your results.

This is useful for words with multiple meanings,
like Jaguar the car brand and jaguar the animal.
Examples: jaguar speed -car or pandas -
site:wikipedia.org

il

When you put a word or phrase in quotes, the
results will only include pages with the same
words in the same order as the ones inside the
quotes. Only use this if you're looking for an exact
word or phrase, otherwise you'll exclude many
helpful results by mistake.

Example: "imagine all the people"

*

Add an asterisk as a placeholder for any unknown
or wildcard terms..

Example: "a * saved is a * earned"











Separate numbers by two periods without spaces
to see results that contain numbers in a range.

Example: camera $50..$100
Search operators

Search operators are words that can be added to searches to help narrow
down the results. Don't worry about memorizing every operator, because
you can also use the Advanced Search page to create these searches.


Operator

How to use it

site:

Get results from certain sites or domains.
Examples: Olympics site:nbc.com and Olympics
site:.gov

link:

Find pages that link to a certain page.

Example: link:YouTube.com

related:

Find sites that are similar to a web address you
already know.

Example: related:time.com

OR

Find pages that might use one of several words.
Example: marathon OR race

info:

Get information about a web address, including
the cached version of the page, similar pages,
and pages that link to the site.

Example: info:google.com

cache:

See what a page looks like the last time Google
visited the site.

Example: cache:washington.edu


Note: When you search using operators or punctuation marks, don't add
any spaces between the operator and your search terms. A search for
site:nytimes.com will work, but site: nytimes.com won't.

Learning

Amplifiers first

If math doesn't help language and language doesn't help math, why don't we teach
first things that amplify everything else? If someone is learning harder than another
guy, and you asked him why, he could say "because I want to be the best." Or, "I want
to be better than that other guy" or, "I want to feel proud of myself". Teaching pride,
excellence and competition, those things affect everything, you should teach them
first. If you don't get those, if you don't make people care, well then really, how hard
do you think they're going to work anywhere else? Discipline and motivation are the
tide that rises all educational subjects ships.

Only master few thigs to become great

You only need to master a couple of things here to become great, you surely don't
need to master half at all. As a matter of fact, you’d probably be much better off only
learning a few of these things and becoming super bad ass at them, than being
relatively bad at all of them. The reason for this is that many of the things here help
you personally so very much more than they help the rest of the world, that you are
much better off focusing on the things that benefit the rest of the world much more
than they benefit you.

This works because the world can do more than you can. 1000 men can build
something amazing, something that try as 'u might, you could never build alone in
your lifetime. The chance that you can greatly influence this world through the use of
many of your fellow man is at least 100 times greater than the chance that you can do
so alone. Why? Take a look around you, how many of the things you use, enjoy, see,
how many of those things were made by a single man?

Be a great discoverer of truth, or detective

How does this relate to the rest of reality that is vastly less tested nor testable? I
believe the learning is that you must look for that other magic part that is so hard to
miss, you must look for the not thing, you must look for the thing that isn’t there, or is
the opposite of the obvious thing, what's the missing part? What should be here that
isn't here? It’s like a great investigator you might see in a popular television show,
movie or book, you could say Sherlock Holmes, Colombo, or Dr. House they account
for the following things lesser detectives never think of: Is my test wrong? Could it be




wrong in this case for special reason? Did something intermittent happen here, is the
current state of the scene not representative of when the crime occurred, rain,
weather, people, full moon? Lighting?

Minimum Viable Education

What is the minimum effective dose of teachable knowledge/skill? Input, process,
output, ala grammar, logic, rhetoric, trivium fame.

Success leaves clues. The most effective often have little mental tricks they apply
when thinking, some are mnemonic, some are turning ideas into locations, some are
pretending new ideas are just like old ideas, and applying the old learnings, etc. Find
those powerful commonalities.

Stop making kids bad versions of Google. We don't need more bad data storage in
human minds, we need more of what the machines can't do yet, creativity, love.

If you must make kids bad versions of Google and shove facts into them for lossy
storage, then at least teach them mnemonic technique and logic first, google-fu, so as
to amplify all their future efforts. Do not teach the amplifiers last, let them pay
dividends over time. I was lucky enough to have logic taught to me first before any
other math's at grade 6, because of an experimental advanced education system.
After logic we learned scheme programming. I think those frameworks greatly helped
me in this life, as nesting of ideas and good data processing is super powerful in all
areas of life.

Better and worse exist, find better, choose better. Do not be a coward and pretend
that worse doesn't exist.

Summary: teach amplifiers first. Then teach minimum effective commonly useful data
processing, then specialize and become great.

Specialization is why we have genders. Dimorphism lets us not over-allocate
excellence in a single place at the cost of another place. Great things come from
specialists. If the value of skill is in opposite proportion to supply of that skill, then
everyone learning the same things by definition means no one will pay for that skill or
knowledge. There's some exclusions to that idea, such as language itself, however the
theme of slapping knowledge/skill on a supply/demand curve is a good one. Much of
this idea is hammer in Xx check Peter Thiel's 0-1. less 1 to 1 horizontal iteration and
more 0 to 1, no one else is working on this thing kind greatness.

What is minimum effective curriculum before specializing?

What is the minimum viable education?

What is the correct execution order of those skills?

For instance, how important is it to teach kids to write essays, when they actually
don't have much useful to say? Maybe you should work on having useful things to say
much harder before you learn how to beautifully say them. Imagine that you did the
opposite, imagine that you taught effective rhetoric before logic, and now you've got
better salesmen of bad ideas. That's worse, not better. Think of the places in the



world where women aren't allowed to drive cars. How did that terrible situation arise?
Great marketing of terrible ideas.


STEAL IDEAS FROM OTHER LIFEFORMS BEFORE THEY DIE OFF

Which organisms are we most likely to benefit from stealing ideas from? Can we
prevent them from going extinct before we get to learn those ideas? Is there a way to
capture the ideas pre-extinction?

Even the tools that we now have to change the blueprints of life, we stole from life.
Bacteria and viruses are the source of our most powerful DNA editing tools currently.

We are meat. Animals are meat. The animals have all kinds of amazing tricks and tools
their meat has developed. We could use some of their tools. If they become extinct,
we can't learn well from them any longer.

If you want to take advantage of the millions of years of building with the best tools
we're aware of, real evolution over long time periods, and you don't want to wait for a
couple million or hundred million years for the next go round of that thing maybe
evolving again, then you should try to prevent extinction of the organisms most useful
to learn from for our own benefit.

Real world testing by doing

Why test kids when you can put them in the real world via the Internet, and have
them solve real problems?

There are all kinds of people out there that have problems that they'd like to have
solved, and these useless kids could be the ones to do it. However, if you can't find a
thing in the real world for these kids to use to practice on, then stop teaching it, it's
obvious no one needs it, or you don't know anyone in the real world, one of the two.
Teaching through story instead of fact bashing

Teaching through story sacrifices bitrate for emotional attachment and depth for
stickiness and virility. This might be why viruses have a quite limited payload.

The reason religions succeeded where science has failed is because they appeal to our
tropes and memes and thousands of years of story, where science is cold and has
nothing.

Must actually have a church, a structure and the songs and ritual stuff that goes
around it, and sadly the us vs them mentality.

Common parts of good stories: Arc, relation, father/son, dark light, mirror, order,
reversal, betrayal, greed , lust, conflict, what are these common powerful tropes?
Which do you like the most? Using us vs them language.

Easy way to learn

If you ever want an easy way to teach kids the importance of geometry, one 18-inch
pizza is more pizza than two 12-inch pizzas. Do the math.

Cinderella effect

Separating kids from parents and giving to state for education e.g. the republic
(Plato's) is at least bad because of this:

"In evolutionary psychology, the Cinderella effect is the alleged higher incidence of
different forms of child-abuse and mistreatment by stepparents than by biological
parents. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella . Evolutionary
psychologists describe the effect as a remnant of an adaptive reproductive strategy
among primates in which males freguently kill the offspring of other males in order to
bring their mothers into estrus, and give the male a chance to fertilize her himself.
There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticisms against it."

Failure of Education system

Essays-section of the book store hides great ideas

It’s rather stupid that much of what you need to be a great person, and have
correct beliefs and actions in this world is hidden in the essays section of the
library and the book store? What a stupid way to name an important category
of the most in depth thinking? Why is Hitchens and Nietzsche and Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Machiavelli, Henry David Thoreau, Will Durant, etc. are hidden in this
stupid category. This category is literally called something we're taught to hate
as kids.

The failure of the education system (Xx There's more content like this in the World
section)

Kids know their time is being wasted with useless knowledge

Kids know you're wasting their time; they know they're never going to use
this shit. If you're too stupid to come up with an example that's
compelling to them when they would use it, then you're dumber than
they are, because you don't realize that you're wasting their time. Stop
wasting everyone's time. There's enough to learn in this world that's
actually useful to learn, teach them that. If you have an hour of math, an
hour of history, an hour of home-ed, where's your hour of motivation?
Where's your hour of visualizing the future? Where's your hour of finding
something to care about? Where's your hour of planning and dreaming
something that spices you up? Where's your hour of the amplifier and
multiplier? The only weak link in the chain that will make any of those
other six or seven hours of school worth a shit. Teaching people things
they will never use or teaching people things that they could use if they
cared, is only as useful as the caring. No caring, no using. You're











amplifying the strong part of the chain, not the weak part. A chain is only
as strong as its weakest link.

We have a motivation problem and they don't teach that in schools

We do not have a knowledge problem. We do not have an education
problem. We have a desire, and will, and motivation, and discipline
problem. It needs to become a class, it needs to have a curriculum and it
needs to be taught, people need to get degrees in it. You should be able
to meet someone not having to go through some esoteric business
training class, not having to go through some religious experience.

Liberal Arts Degrees and Education system

Everyone gets these liberal arts degrees and goes to a liberal arts college,
and no one knows what liberal arts means. I thought I knew, because, you
know, I went to college for a while, and I was around people that went to
colleges, and I thought that it was like applying butter to a piece of bread;

I liberally apply butter to bread because it tastes good. It turns out that in
reality, the liberal arts, the word liberal means free. They made it a long
time ago, say 2,300 years ago, 2,400 years ago, about 300-400 BC, they
decided that the trades, such as building and farming and commerce, like
shop keeping, things like that, were for idiots. Those were the lowest
things you could learn, and that a free man, that had his own freedom and
wasn't a slave, should learn the awesome things and then they
categorized those seven awesome things into a set of three and a set of
four. The set of three, the trivium, those - believe it or not, that's the root
of the word trivia - they didn't even like these three things. You might
understand it as reading, writing, and arithmetic. They understood it as
grammar, which is getting data in, logic, which is manipulating the data,
and rhetoric, which is speaking the data and getting the data back out.
They didn't even look up to that, that badass input-processing-output
system, they didn't even like that. That was where you started, and where
you were to end up was the four things that they actually liked. Now mind
you, I just told you three of the seven things that are considered the
liberal arts. These next four, when I tell them to you, you'll have a
complete understanding of what the liberal arts are. Notice that they're
not building, they're not engineering, they're not business, they're not
medicine, they're not the things that are the most useful things in the
whole world, but they think that they're the most important.

Multiple choice tests should be destroyed - no more accidental success.

The entire education system was designed a thousand years ago

The entire education system is designed around a decision that was made
a couple thousand years ago, that was wrong. The world that we live in
today is not very similar to the world that we lived in then. Business, and
medicine, and basically the things that people look down upon now, those
are the important things. The things that they thought were important,
like philosophy - ehh, we've kind of got most of that stuff figured out. We
don't really need more people in that area. If you don't think that we've
made diminishing returns in the philosophy area, there's 200,000 people a



day dying right now. What percentage of those people are dying from lack
of philosophy? They're dying because their bodies are falling apart. That's
200,000 people a day, and one day soon, you will be one of those people.
If you don't want to be a rotting piece of meat, a walking corpse, a short,
less than a blink of an eye geologically, then you should be focused on shit
that gets you to stick around a little bit longer. If you find yourself
following the suggestions of thousands of years old, dead people, who
optimized for a world that they lived in, that is not very similar to the
world that you live in, you are fucking up. If you're taking liberal arts and
you don't understand that the choices, the false choices, the artificially
restricted choices that you get to choose from in regards to your
curriculum exist because some wrong person, that has decided that music
and philosophy are anywhere near as important as engineering and
medicine, that was what they decided to call the free arts, the liberal arts,
then you're making the wrong choice.

Here's the points to summarize. I understand what the liberal arts are. It's
a judgement call. It's an artificial restriction of your choices that you think
you're getting a wide, balanced, well-rounded education, when in reality
you're being crippled, being taught the least valuable information that
you can learn, being taught things that you will find the least useful
possible.

We've had all types of bubbles in this world. We've had bubbles in
housing, we've had bubbles in stock markets, and now there's a bubble in
the education system. And bubbles - unfortunately, human beings
psychologically don't react well to them. We're very okay with increases
in pay, we're very okay with increases in quality of life, but we're very not
okay with decreases in pay and decreases in quality of life. It's called the
Keynesian ratcheting effect in economics. Just like a ratchet, turns really
easily one way, doesn't turn so easily the other way. When you have a
bubble in education because people have forgotten why education exists,
education is not supposed to be babysitting in the collegiate level.
Education is not supposed to be learning for learning's sake, and if it ever
was, fuck those people. That was a bad decision, a bad design. There's a
better way to live. I believe in utility. I believe in Scivival.

This is what I feel liberal arts, education and much of what the education
that exists in this world is, it's learning the names of things and learning
that they exist, and never deriving useful value, or getting any type of
actual benefit from that learning. Learning to learn, for learning's sake, so
that you can say that you did and take a regurgitated test where you puke
facts back on the paper the same way that you received the facts in the
first place, and then rapidly forget that crap because you never ever use it
again in the real world, what could be worse? What could be worse than
convincing someone that to be a good person in a society, and to be
useful in a society, they need to learn things that don't matter and
understand them in a way that's not useful, only to forget them again



shortly soon when their life and their consciousness and the supporting of
their family and the obtainment of their goals revolves around all of the
things that you excluded from their education?

Personal finance, personal presentation. How to be a good friend? How to
be fair to yourself? What does being fair to yourself look like? What does
being fair to your friends look like? What does being too easy on others
look like? What does losing friends because you didn't get things signed in
writing and then now their own subconscious works again them and they
misremember the past, because it's financially profitable for them to
misremember the past? It's easy to misremember the past.

Liberal Arts degrees

If you still think the liberal arts are there to teach you how to learn, you
misunderstand why they are there. There is a study of how people learn,
there is the ability to major in education, there is the study of where
knowledge comes from, there's a fancy word for it. If you want to learn
what is knowable and how we know what is knowable, and perhaps the
best ways to learn things, if you think learning things is memorizing things,
well then you should study memory, and that should be a course. People
who compete in memory competitions, that should be a course. I
wouldn't be surprised if the liberal arts removed that from the ability of
the course selection guide, because it's too goddam useful. We need
things that are less useful, so that we turn people into losers. They don't
understand they're losers, because we use proof by complexity.

Better education results

If I can get you better results for yourself in a shorter time frame than
college does, is not the education you get with me worth more money?
Specifically since it is saving you more of your time.

Important topics of education

If you didn't take ethics and how to be a good friend, how to manage your
personal finances, and how to stick up for yourself and how to be fair to
yourself, which everyone knows in the entire world that those things are
vitally important. If you learned the order of the planets from the sun
instead of those thing, you fucked up. You spent your time the wrong
way. You are less effective and you were less of a good person and a less
powerful being now because you deprived yourself, maybe by accident,
maybe through ignorance, you didn't know you could learn those things. If
you think liberal arts is to teach you how to learn, that's called
epistemology, and you can go into that and education and the study of
learning as a thing. When they're teaching you music, they're not teaching
you how to learn. When they're teaching you writing, they're not teaching
you how to use your memory - they're different goddam things. Don't fall
for the hype, don't fall for the bullshit. If you want to create super
learners, I guarantee you that your things that you study won't look
anything like the curriculums that are out there now.

You can find excellence by diving deeper into areas than others

We've gone far and wide. In summary: if you think the liberal arts are
giving you a clear, unbiased option of learning from all of the things that



are learnable, you are widely, widely far from the mark. You're totally
wrong. In colleges, you get to choose from a course list. That course list is
taught by humans. Those humans teach what they feel they're capable of
teaching, and often times with a hell of a lot of guidelines. I don't think
that you could find a more restrictive, less choice-based, less varied, less
structured way to learn a thing on the whole planet. It's the most
organized, the least adventurous, the least varied. There's the least
number of options available to you. That's the opposite of a wide-ranging
education. A wide-ranging education would be you opening an
encyclopedia or an atlas and you pointing to a page, and that's what
you're learning. There you go. You have all the things available to you.
Having available to you to learn all the things, that's actually a wide-
ranging education. That's actually how you might find a passion that other
people haven't that you can profit from. That's how you can find an
excellence; by diving deeper into an area than other people have.

Chronological education

The education system revolves around you not getting to learn a new
thing until you learn the last thing. In case you didn't learn the last thing,
you don't get to learn the next thing. They keep you in that class again
and again and again and then and only then when they think you'll benefit
from a harder class that builds on the last class do you earn the
opportunity to learn that new thing.

If all the knowledge is free, then why would you pay for an education? If
the knowledge is free, what are you paying for? To waste your time and
your money?

How do you tell who is smart

Teaching what they wont use

If you want people to learn, there are things that the learner never uses.
Then you can make an actual study guide that you expect them to finish
that you can charge for that they can actually use. So if I tell you Hey! Go
on Alibaba, buy something you like, stock it at home, sell it, you'll get rich,
that's one thing. I tell you we're setting up an account at Alibaba now. Ok,
now we're logging in, now we're looking at the bestsellers. Now we're
going and we're looking in the retail market, we're seeing what they sell
for, OK, there's enough profit. Now we're going to place an order and
we're going to have it shipped this way to your house. Then we're going to
put an ad out. It's going to have your phone number and you're actually
going to answer it. Walking you through the steps and actually getting you
to do them and holding you to a higher standard is more valuable to you
then just knowing a thing exists. Knowing that sales exist is nothing
compared to being able to sell. Knowing that dancing exists is nothing
compared to being able to dance. Getting the premium content out there
that there is a thing that can be done well and here are some ways to do
it. Getting him into your paid program where, because they've paid, they'll
actually follow through and you discover that if people don't pay, they
don't follow through. Look at the completion rate for massive online
courses versus normal courses. It's like four times higher for a normal



course. Why? Because people paid for it, they see loss, they feel sense of
loss and so if you're in the education business, you should have paid
content. You should have free content. You probably should even change
the price of your content, like drug companies do based on who's buying
it.

They charge you money to do it, they take all of your time to do it, and it
was all based on a thousands, multiple thousands years ago judgement
call as to why these ephemeral, artsy fartsy, hard to iterate on, hard to get
feedback on, hard to even choose one way of living over another way of
living. We know one way of building beats the shit out of another one,
because we can measure it. Xx To do what? Paragraph vague/point
missing

Failure of the education system

Isn't it a little odd that all of the things that businesses and professionals
pay thousands upon thousands to go to boot camps to learn could be
easily taught in school, like scheduling, goal setting, positive feedback and
loops?

Imagine someone's flabby arm, and they're having a conversation with it,
looking at it and say to it, / don't understand this flabby arm. I want it to
be stronger. Then, I tell it about all the different ways that you can get
stronger; about eating protein, about doing curls and chin-ups, and doing
pull-ups, and all the things that would help it grow. However, it just sits
there and it just doesn't do anything. No matter how many different
things I tell it, it never gets stronger. So, dear Internet, why doesn't talking
to my muscle make it stronger? And that you see, is the reason that
education doesn't work. We don't need more people to be told things. We
need the people to do things.

Words

XX controversional/funny: Stop diminishing the meaning of the word survivor

I don't particularly like when they call everyone a survivor, like a rape survivor -
is rape usually fatal? What's the point of the word survivor, if you didn't avoid
being killed? There should be perhaps a new word for a person who has avoided
being raped, as survivors have avoided being killed? Dickavoiderpro? Stop
breaking the language, because you enduring something shitty, horrible and
terrible, doesn't make you a survivor, surviving makes you a survivor, and
surviving means avoiding death, not avoiding rape, not avoiding getting your
limbs ripped off. If you got into a fight with a bear, got all your arms and legs
ripped off, and still survived, then you're a survivor. Notice, you still lose the
fight pretty bad, however, even in losing, you are a survivor, because you didn't
die.

If there was no threat of death, it's the wrong word. Go make a new word for
enduring and living with events and shit that sucks. Don't steal the word
survivor from the countless people that actually avoided actual life ending
injuries. It's supposed to be a badge of honor, not a badge of sadness. Cancer
survivor, good. Getting license from DMV survivor, who gives a fuck.


Process



Creativity

Stop listening so that you may speak.

If you spend all your time absorbing music which other people created; reading books
which other people created; watching movies which other people created; watching
other people have fun; listening to other people's jokes - it is very hard to be
producing, when you're absorbing. We're not full duplex - you can't really listen when
you're talking, you can't really talk when you're listening, you can't really create or be
an individual or do that thing that only you can do, if you're busy absorbing everyone
else's consciousness and not being your own consciousness. Now, do you need to
start your life absorbing other people's consciousness?

Yes, you do. You just need to learn a language, learn customs, thrive, eat, break bread,
make love, enjoy. You need to do that. Once you've done enough of that, got the low
hanging free and once you got the Pareto principle 80 percent of the results for 20
percent of the input, you need to switch gears - you need to give back. You've been a
child, you've eaten from your father's hand - time to be a father. You spoke the
language, you use the language, you read the words - make your own words. You
think that there's not a place in this world that you can have an impact, but if you
focus your mind regardless of how retarded you might think you are, with enough
focus you can make an impact.

You don't exist if all you think are other people's thoughts. You must give your mind
the freedom and the blank canvas to paint your own identity, to sing your song out
into the world, and be heard as no one ever before you. To be only a mirror of the
random media and friends that you interact with, is to waste the unique gifts your
ancestors passed down to you. Be yourself, be the best you can be. Choose who that
is. Don't be lazy with it. Your standards for who you demand you will be, are the most
important standards you will ever have.

Silence is golden

In a world where being creative is so valuable, it literally pays to know that your
brain loves to fill silence with cool ideas of its own. That's why people come up
with such interesting ideas in the shower, but much rarer in other places, for the
shower is one of the few places that people choose silence and solitude.
Rejecting the noise of the world lets your amazing pattern finding and creative
brain do what it does better than any other machine on the planet, generate
interesting and possible futures. Sit in silence, but not as a monk trying to
destroy thought. Love your thought, play with your thought, it is the closest
thing to the real you you're likely to find if you search. Pay attention to your
own thoughts and explore them as you would the mind of someone you'd just
met for the first time. What's going on in this super computer when I rest my
eyes :)

Being uniquely creative

You need to keep your ears and eye open, or you'll converge on the same ideas others
do, and not realise it.

A lot of comedians try not to watch other comedy, because they think that somehow
it's going to prevent them from accidentally doing other people's jokes. What they
don't understand is that they'll just accidentally do them a different way. They'll



accidentally do them by having a global consciousness affect them and execute the
same joke through their mind, through a third party instead of directly through them
watching the comedy and forgetting that they remembered it. If you had to give
somebody the excuse as to why they just gave them the joke somebody else did, what
you think should be more believable? "I don't watch comedy" or "actually watching
comedy, making sure you're not doing the same fucking jokes".

Everything is copied

I guess the moral of the story there is, I have the same error in my brain where
I'm trying to avoid polluting my brain with other dudes' content and in reality I
shouldn't be. I should be shit talking their content just as I always have, because
it's too stupid to actually copy anything out anyway.

Humor xx(this might fit better in respect)

Harnessing your natural processing power

Why I like set theory

Your brain Is great at knowing where things are in relationship to other things,
because it is really useful for getting around in the world, and because of that, you
will find that taking ideas and putting them into groups and sets in your mind, allows
you to harness your positional and navigation based intelligence and harness it
towards ideas that don't really have real places in the real world, or even phsyical
forms that you can touch or interact with.

I think that is par tof the resaon that set theory and venn diagrams allow you to
understand complex ideas so much easier, because they act as a convolution layer
that takes their nonphysical form and coverts it into your mind into a physical
representation so you can work with it. This is kind of like how when video cards
came out, and it was discovered they could solve certain problems faster than cpu's
that you would take your problem and make it look like the things that graphcis cards
were good at working with, and then you couuld harness that power.

This is similar to how when you take a building, you take its measurements and turn
them into numebrs that calculators are equations are good at working on. You
couldn't very well take your 2x4 piece of wood and insert it directly into the calculator
to perform calculations on, the calcultor would break and your teacher would get
pretty angry at you. So you create an abstraction and turn the piece of wood you
want to work on inot a middle layer of numbers that you can then harness the
processing power of the calculator with. Then when you've got the numbers that you
need you can export that data out of the nuber layer back into the wood layer of the
real world again, and perhaps build a house.

Sleep

Sleep thought might be better than awake thought

There is a chance that you learn more and thinkn about better htings when you're
sleeping than when you're awake. It's basicly a time when your mind truly gets to
decide what it shall focus on. If you never slept, then much more of your focus would
be controlled by the media, your habits, etc. Perhaps all the crazy situations and
scenarios you dream about are actually more important to your survival and growth
than much of what you might be normally thinking about during the day, when you
have more control over your thoughts.


Focus



What not to focus on

Working on the unique versus improving/marketing the already known
Unique useful data is the most valuable to the world
Non unique data is usually more actionable to you

Ideas are only as useful as people are aware of them.

The global awareness of an idea is
Probabilistic
Marketing based
Trend based

If you find a great idea that's under marketed, or misunderstood, fix it.

If you see an idea that needs created, create it.

Creating new ideas or testing and proving others is more useful globally
and throughout time than creating yet another copy of the same ideas
already out there. This assumes that the old ideas already have good
distribution networks by have allowed them to spread effectively and
have their value judged.

Should you build new ideas or spread good buy under-marketed ones?

Build or spread or build then spread.

Counting from 0

Seems stupid, until you try to figure out when your should get pregnant to have your childs
birthday the same as your won. Lets say you are born on October 1st. Kids take 9 months
from conception to birth. So 9 months after the years starts would be the 9th month right?
September is the right month right? So you should get pregnant January first. Oh but wait,
it takes 9 full months. So 9 full months after January is actually October. The end of
September begins the 9th month, which has number 10. Now you know what programmers
count from 0. xx does counting from 0 make this more intuitive? Saying 9 complete
months, or the end of 9 months, (starting the 10th) also makes it intuitive. This seems
similar to the fencepost error where you need n+1 because you must end after the end of
the fence piece.

Intelligence

General Intelligence

The folly of measuring Intelligence

First, intelligence isn't knowledge. Measuring intelligence is a little
misleading and stupid. Let me give you an example. Most people don't
know the difference between intelligence and knowledge, so we can
either word around the common misunderstanding by never using the
world intelligence as the scientists do. This is the same problem I had with
the language that was used oddly and specifically in the social science in
regards to humans having no instincts, whereas the common man will tell
you we definitely do, such as the fear of heights, or the survival instinct,
fight or flight response, all kinds of stuff, however, they don't call those
things instincts the same way that researchers don't want knowledge to
be called intelligence.

Natural IQ Selection

If you think tall parents tend to have tall kids, and short parents short kids,
then probably black parents black kids. If there's so much heredity going
on, and we're all pretty heavily influenced by our ancestors, and our
ancestors were individually differently stupid or smart from each other,



then why would it be so hard to believe that the same mechanism that
changed your color and your language, also changed your IQ or reaction
time? There is no god damn equality, please stop dreaming. The
difference that existed in those individuals then, got executed and
perhaps amplified through the ages and through time, and low and
behold, we now have differences, just like they had.

Apparently no one has made the case as to why being less intelligent
could be an advantage that could be selected for. First, just because it's
not as far as long as some other populations selected for trait, it doesn't
mean that it is not being selected for, it just might be taking longer, as the
result of chance. Second, it takes lots of calories to maintain these brains,
and I would assume harder thinking, more thinking, would incur more
caloric cost. And third, ever seen a nerd busy thinking instead of lifting
weights? Xx There was a study I read that found that hard studying
increases your appetite, even though studying hard (increased brain work)
only increases caloric burn very, very little (like 10 kcal). Find that study!

If it's the case that the smarter you are the weaker you are, generally,
then why wouldn't that be useful in an environment where you're always
chasing your food? I can think of a litany of reasons that being too smart
for a thing makes you bad at the thing. Have you heard that you can't get
hired as a police officer if your IQ is too high? Perhaps they're making the
right decision for the resources they have, in that it costs too much to
train cops that quit, because they move on to better things.

Big G (General Intelligence)

If you were deprived of basically all enriching information and born on an
island, just existed and didn't have culture or have never heard a joke,
never heard a song, you would still have the Big G that you were born
with. Let's see Big G for what it is: it's a useful metric to decide whether
there are some exercises that have good fall-over usefulness.

Qualitative value of applied knowledge
Doing the right stuff first

If you're the smart guy that's done all the right stuff first, you can
make gold out of other people's fuck ups, whereas if you're the fuck
up, you can make shit out of other people's greatness.

The uncanny effectiveness of children brought up with a focused
goal; Tiger Woods, polar sisters Magnus

The question that I have for myself is what's a word, what's a description
that exists or should be invented that describes a person that gets the
benefits from excellence of knowledge and action, and doesn't live
without the great benefits of excellent knowledge and action applied in






the real world? Is there a word to describe the vast, vast number of
intelligent, capable and genius level, literally genius level, such as learn a
new language in a couple weeks if you want to read a book in that
language, madness shit, Wittgenstein level stuff? It's funny, the number of
these geniuses that are Jewish. He was Jewish, by the way, like three
quarters Jewish. It seems to be a lot easier to be a super-genius if you're
Jewish in this world. What's the word for people that know a great thing,
but don't do it? Is it hypocrite? Perhaps. I mean, a hypocrite will say that
people should do this, but they exclude themselves from the set that they
call people, or make up a fancy excuse for why they don't need to. Maybe
calling those people hypocrites is the answer. I don't know, it doesn't
seem artful enough to me.

There's a difference between quality of belief and quality of intellect, and
the ability to synthesize ideas with a person. Two people could be in the
same place, but arrive there by totally different mechanisms. You may go
into a bar, and find someone that works there because that was the best
you could get, whereas someone else is there because they read
TripAdvisor and that was the most delicious place in the world. One
person was in the place due to the end result of a hunt for excellence, one
was there because they had no other options. I think a lot of ideas and
behaviors in this world are arrived at in similarly opposing methods -
some people arrive at a belief through ignorance and some through
complete knowledge. If you think that both of those people are equally
qualified to speak to issues because they chose the same action, well,
then you're in for a rude awakening. This is because one, through
complete knowledge one has a lot of new options, things you can learn.
Person that got there through ignorance or was forced there... Can't really
build anything new with that guy.

The learning intake order of operations is really important for being
effective.

Some math you can't do in a randomized order. It's not commutative, I
believe is the term for it. And so is martial arts. If you learn all the fake
ones before the real ones, you're basically starting from scratch, but if you
learn the real ones and then look at the fake ones, then you basically kind
of just adopt what's useful and ignore the shit that sucks. It's kind of the
same with critical thinking. If you take a person that's a great critical
thinker, and you put them in an environment of stupidity and falsehood,
yet there's still a couple good ideas there, he's qualified to pick out the
good ideas and ignore the dog shit. Therefore, if you're a smart, critical-
thinking guy, you could probably derive benefit from reading lots of things
which suck, which may cripple or poison a weaker mind. I guess it's like
the ability to be an omnivore and digest the things that are useful and be
immune to the things that are harmful. It's really an order of operations
issue. If you get the wrong books first, you cripple yourself and get the
worst things, the wrong things, out of the consequent books. If you



instead get the right books first, then it just amplifies your progress. That's
why the rich get richer, the smart get smarter, and the divergence grows.

Mere awareness is not a skill

Similar to all other skills in the world, just because you know there is a
way to do a thing better, doesn't mean that you can do the thing better.
Mere awareness is not skill. Skill comes with correct knowledge practiced
over time. What use is there knowing a tool exists and even owning it, if
you never get the inspiration that it’s now the right time for that tool?
Wisdom

Common wisdom is only so among those who are not. Xx What does this
mean?

The wisdom of crowds and ignorance of mobs

You only get wisdom if everyone is guessing independently. If everyone
can see everyone else’s guesses, its worse, not better. Xx Idea left
unclear?

What is Wisdom?

Wisdom is when your intelligence has been applied to a body of
knowledge over a long enough time, and is in congruence enough with
the underlying situation of the world that you have a very strong boat
floating, high sailing the right way down river.

What most people think is common wisdom is surely not, and may be the
definition of the fallacy of proof by popularity.

The wise person is usually kind of alone and not that powerful, but just
knows what is likely to happen if you do a certain thing.

We need to direct intellect to more motivation, belief, discipline based things
The reason Uber was able to revolutionize, or rather create, a new
industry that served the same purpose the taxi industry did, however, at
much lower cost, was because there was a shit load of unused resources
sitting around. There were people and cars that could drive, and there
were roads with space, and everything was ready but the glue was
missing. The glue that was required was an app that put people that
wanted rides together with people that could give rides. And so, what is
the problem that we have in the get-shit-done world?

We’ve got tons and tons and tons of unused resources, which is the ability
for human beings to actually do shit. What’s missing? Well, it’s not more
knowledge. We don’t need more knowledge, we have too much
knowledge. It’s all free, it’s all there, it’s all the best it’s ever been and you
are using none of it. Who cares? You learn more? Great. Now, there’s
more stuff that you know that you're not using. What we need is a human
desire based, belief based, motivation based, discipline based, whatever
style you want to go for, glue that bridges the gap between all the stuff
that we could do and actually doing it. No amount of shoving facts into
people's heads is getting that job done.

Processing Power Overhead

Eye contact. If you are a persuasionist or hyper aware, then when you
look at someone, you see everything. You see posture, breathing, facial



expression, lips, dryness, heart rate, you see everything. You want to
enjoy being around another human being, and absorbing all of them -
seeing things in them that they don't see, and seeing things in them that
maybe no one has ever seen before, because they haven't been trained to
absorb everything that that person is or is doing and is thinking and is
feeling.

If you've spent a lot of time learning that shit, focusing on it and it's a
habit for you, then looking at people has a higher overhead for you as a
hyper aware person. By shifting your gaze from the interesting show that
is the person that you're speaking to into space allows you to access
different thoughts and different feelings, because the direction you look
affects what you think about.

I may refine these things in the future. You only have so much processing
power. What has been useful to you in the past as a human being, much
of your processing power has been visual, and has been location based.
Where's the food, where's my house? Where's the threat, where's my
house? You need to know those things. When you see smart people
looking off into space, it may be because they're able to start using the
visual where the fuck is the thing organizational brain system to organize
ideas, because they're not eating up that processing power actually
looking at what's around them. When you just stare off into space, you're
not actually looking at anything, but you're not being triggered to keep
engaging in your actual Where's this, where's that system. You might be
able to reassign that visual speculation processing power to process
better ideas.

A word to describe what you've learned multiplied by your brain power

There should be a word to describe what you've learned multiplied by
how powerful your brain is (Xx I think it's called intellect). Maybe that's
called wisdom. If we have a good enough understanding of how our
consciousness works to separate intelligence from knowledge, then surely
we must see that either one by itself is worthless, and that benefits are
only had when the two are combined. Need we invent a new word for
applied intelligence over time? Like power is energy x time ? Mental power
shall be intelligence applied to gathering and synthesizing new knowledge
over time.

Being Correct

Knowing when you're right or wrong

Knowing whether you're right or wrong about one thing is super
important, because if you think you're right and you're not, you will stop
learning. You'll be wrong and you'll force yourself into a conversation,
depriving the person who is right the significance that they should get
socially, and the ability to influence that they should get socially. Instead it
will be replaced with your misguided ignorance. Thus, if you want to be
right about things, you not only need to do work to be right, but you also
need to do the work of knowing whether you're right or not. If you're a



person that only speaks in absolutes of right and wrong, you're already
fucked.

A much more intelligent and realistic measurement is what is the chance
that you're right in numbers? Do you think this, if 50/50? Or 70/30? How
much time have you put in? Do you have access to knowledge other
people don't? How much thoughts of other people have you read? How
confident should you be in your measurements? Now, let me give you an
example. The people in this world that are most right, are also the people
that are most likely to know when they're wrong, continue to learn and
continue to work and understand and test themselves empirically to see
whether they actually got it or not.

This has happened to me personally a shitload of times, but I'll give you
this most recent example. There was a thing that I read that said "If you
get an AIDS test and you get positive and the test is 95% accurate, how
likely are you to have AIDS?" They give this test to all kinds of people and
it's actually so misunderstood that it's called th e false positive paradox.

It's called paradox not because paradoxes actually exist, it's called
paradox because people's understanding of the world is so poor and so
often in odds with the actual world, that we decide to call those things
that we commonly get wrong paradoxes. A paradox exists because
human's perception of reality is so commonly inaccurate in regards to this
specific thing, we call that a paradox. There are a couple other definitions,
but for the way I'm using this word, it's accurate. I thought I understood
what the false positive paradox was. I thought if you just knew what the
likelihood that you had it in the first place, that that was the magic, that
understanding the prevalence was the magic. Then, I tested myself and I
got it wrong, and had to Google it again. So, I thought I understood it and I
turned out to be wrong and I thought I understood it again and so I got it
wrong again; and so I kept Googling it and kept searching. Now, I have a
different understanding than lots of other people do because I understand
the Bayes theorem, the false positive paradox, the prosecutors fallacy and
the more advanced scientific understanding which is sometimes there's
this thing called specificity and there a thing called accuracy, and they're
different, (xx last sentence - rewrite, lots of words without explanation)

Accuracy is how likely it is to give you the knowledge that a thing is there
when it's actually there. Specificity is how likely the thing is to tell you that
it's not there when it's not there. You'll get fuckups in both directions.
Sometimes it'll be there and you won't catch it, therefore your test is less
accurate. Sometimes you'll think it's there and it's really not and
sometimes it's not there, but you think it is. You end up with this set of
four: is it really there or not; did we really think it's there or not. And then
looking at that table of four, you've got to do the math for each one of
those sections and depending on how you're question is phrased you can
derive those answers that you're looking for. None of those previous
examples that I found went as deep into false positive, false negatives and



understanding P values specificity, accuracy. That was the most advanced
actual executable useful knowledge of it. It was more advanced than the
prosecutor's fallacy. It was more advanced than the false positive
paradox. It was, what I found to be the most useful world war application
of the knowledge that can from an in depth understanding of Bayes
theorem. If you just see Bayes theorem sitting there on a piece of paper,
good luck deriving meaning out if that shit; you have to know what the
abbreviations mean. And in Wikipedia, the fucking abbreviations aren't
fucking defined and yet you have to find out what those variables, what
those Greek letters actually fucking mean. I actually edited one of the
Wikipedia pages to include a definition because I saw it as quite stupid
that a normal intelligent person that understood the algebra and
understand that you could divide and multiply things which it's all it
fucking is. It's literally just a vision of multiplication. I didn't think that a
person that understood algebra would need to go find some other
magical hidden statistical page that predefined these dumb Greek letters
when they could just be defined right next to it as some of them were but
some of them were not. (xx rewrite - a lot of unnecessary words and
information)

Knowledge that makes you less certain

I don't like interesting knowledge that makes you less certain. I love the
feeling of progress and excellence, and that only comes with certainty. If
you don't know why the right thing is right - you don't really know it's the
right thing. I know the best burger in the city... How many places have you
had? Oh, three? You don't know the best burger.

Creativity

Humor but not funny

Funny stuff is funny because it doesn't make sense. Creative ideas are
new and interesting, but not funny, because they work. They cause you to
feel awe and inspiration more than giggles. They're related, but one
becomes reality, and the other fantasy, unless it's a prank, then its real.
The amateur imitates what the master improves
Quote by Richard
Capture all your ideas!

I'm having a little bit of trouble with the rabbit hole. If you're smart and
fast, you realize that everything is really related to everything else, and
that everything can be learned from and applied everywhere else, and
that there's an entire world ripe for improvement out there. You come up
with basically a million great ideas, and the art is to just get them all
captured and sort them later, so that is what I'm doing now, I just want to
capture these very rough ideas and fuck with them later.

Negative space. What's not there? Inductive and deductive logic.

"You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say,
'Why not?'".

From < https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert F. Kennedy > (MiSATTRIBUTED, however

Try things that are old somewhere else, but new here. (Invent)

Trying ideas that work on one thing, on other things.

Cross jurisdictions with ideas for undiscovered power
Proof of work and signaling theory

You could have invented proof of work for Bitcoin, or
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to
tell Computers and Humans Apart) for websites, you
must have a phone number to sign up for a Gmail
account, because they are all proofs of work that verify
honest communication or identity, the same proofs of
work that animals use to pretty up their "mating area"
or perform their mating dance or display those cool
colors that say hey I'm poisonous, so don't eat me.

The

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap principle

which says that reliable signals must be costly to
the signaler in order to be trusted. Could be used
to generate all kinds of antispam, and useful
social inventions, if the effective evolved principle
was experimented with to apply it different places
in the real world.

Location, speed, size, combination, color, material, sound, payment
plans

Take what works one place, and see if it works another place.
Globalization is one of the simplest forms of this. If a hotdog
stand works in Chicago, maybe it will work in Shanghai. In that




model, you just changed the location. Maybe you keep
location, but change packaging color instead. Or, maybe you
carbonate it, you get the idea. If something works in one area
of life, it's very common for it to work in other areas, too.
TLDR: What useful and effective evolved strategies can be
exported to other disciplines and great gains received?

Is not the feedback system in eBay a digital execution of what
we have in normal human to human relationships of "trust".
Mind you, the eBay account that you're giving your "trust" to,
has no face, never invites you to its birthday party, however
the principle still works, and for the same reasons that it
works for human on human communication.

Improve on things that are not new, but known good. (Iterate)

This is the meaning of the phrase Artists imitate, masters steal.

Tropes

If it hasn't been done in a book or a movie, then it may have never
happened at all. Whatever you're thinking, whatever you are
experiencing, it's very likely someone in one of these fictional
worlds has gone through something almost the same as you. You
can learn from what they learned from, or you could meet the
author and see what insights he might have into the situation,
because he's obviously put some thought into it to make a story out
of it.

Once you see that all events are kind of the same events over and
over with little twists on them, you can export tactics from

When you should worry about creativity

You must build off of greatness, you must not try to create your own
greatness, to catchup, and then try and built off your own. You cripple
yourself by not catching up to where the world already is. Greatness
rarely emerges from a vacuum. When should you make your own martial
art. Probably after you've learned a few others. When you will get more
out of yourself than you will leaching others creativity. When should you
write your own music? After you've heard lots of other peoples.

Creative Ingredients

Perfect pitch means you can hear a sound and figure out instantly how to
create that sound. I would say that food would have something similar.
When you take food, do you know how to make that flavor? You can also




kind of relate it to dance. If you see someone do a dance move on TV, can
you do that dance move and how long would it take you to try? You'll find
some people can and most people cannot.

That's the difference between ingredients and finished output. If you
know how to dance and can break a dance set into its little pieces, then
now that you have those ingredients you can combine them into a new
and beautiful thing. Just like painting, and brushes and canvas are just like
words. So, if you take a beautiful phrase or sentence, and then you take
those words, does that mean you can go create a new amazing sentence
out of those words? Well, maybe, maybe not. There's a place in this world
for beautiful sentences, and then there's a place for people that can
create them. There's a place for people that can create movies and there's
a place for people to watch them. The universals that I'm most addicted
to that allow me to create new things are surely not even of interest to
anyone else unless they want to create new things themselves. There are
a lot of people that are happy to eat without watching the butchering of
the animal.

Shower thoughts & freeing up the mind for creativity

Shower thoughts are really cool. They are more creative than what
you would normally think of, because it actually broadens the range
of inputs you are using to synthesize new ideas, which is what
creativity is. Your environment greatly affects the creative output of
your mind, because your mind is basically trying to pre-calculate
routines that might appear so that it's responsively faster if those
routines occur.

It's part of what deja vu is. Your brain already pre-calculated a thing
that might happen a long time ago when you weren't noticing, then
it actually happened and you're like - Hey wait a sec, I kind of
recognize this shit. Shower thoughts are broader, because the range
that we use for our creativity is actually limited by our surroundings.
For instance, if we're in a social setting around a lot of people, our
brains would try to optimize the relations between people, the
environment, the posture. There are so many social things that go
on in a social setting that occupy your mind, like trying to
understand what other people are saying, trying to educate them,
tell them things etc. It's very consuming to the mind, so when you
are in the shower you probably don't have music, you probably
don't have to think where to go next, or people you are trying to
impress. It allows you to free your mind to create and synthesize
new ideas using a broad range of inputs that can be a lot more
random. This is because they're not being refined or restricted to
the same content matter that exists during the rest of the day,
whether we are being influenced by work, or school or by a lover or
any other type of social setting.

Creative Excellence



Creative mix

If you are a creative, or a dedicated, person and just will throw lots of shit
at the wall; if you identify what excellence is, the components that make it
up and then just fuck around in the area and mix things together, whether
it be different sounds, the correct beats, or different colors, shapes and
textures for art, and then you mix and permutate those into what might
be an okay-looking form that hasn't been well marketed yet. Then you can
create quality production and any creative art that didn't require insane
amounts of training such as actually playing an instrument instead of
sampling it, singing instead of having someone else sing or sampling it,
actually using digital art tactics or the assistance of others to execute an
idea visually or animate.

You can create beautiful things even if you can't specifically do the thing
yourself. Many books are written by multiple parties; there's an editor,
there's the illustrator that does the cover, there's the person that writes
the text and sometimes there's expert consultants that you go to, to see
whether these things are expert on or done properly.

All you need to know is what excellence looks like, mix it up, mash it up
and through that exercise you might discover a new form of excellence
that people didn't see previously. Now, you've not only permutated
something beautiful, but you've also added to the science, which would
amplify and allow others to go and permutate beauty based on your new
archetype and that has multiplying effects throughout time.

Hard to train people to be creative & feedback loops

I think part of the reason why it's so hard to train people to be creative is
that there's no feedback loop by which they can, without someone else's
trusted input, be told that what they did actually sucks. But, if you're
building a website, and the website doesn't load, you know it sucks - it's
not up for debate. If you draw a graphic, you might think it's great, even if
to the rest of the world it is not. Having aesthetic understanding inside
your brain as a human, even that is pretty common, which is why you
don't see people walking around wearing garbage bags, usually, unless
you're trying to drop weight for some sport. It's because people think that
shit looks ugly. Feels bad, looks bad, smells bad, sounds bad. They have
aesthetic internal programming which tells them that sucks. But, the more
advanced the creative topic is, the harder and harder that feedback loop
gets.

You choose an infrastructure. You choose a lifestyle. You choose a way to
write a passage, a sentence, a paragraph, and you have no realistic way of
knowing how far percentage-wise you are into the greatness that could
exist. Therefore, it's hard to know when you should stop going down a
path and work on the next thing. It's hard to know whether what you've
built is the best it can be or not, and so the more creative and the harder
it is to find a feedback loop to help the world train your output. A



feedback loop says, Hey, that's good! Do more of that! or That sucks, do
less of that. The quicker and more obvious those things are, the easier it is
to path against your own will, or with your own will, to greatness. When
you get these creative things where you can't even generate your own
internal, reliable opinion on whether it sucks or not, let alone an external
trusted opinion, and you can't test it, well then, where you end up is much
more variable and much more function of your original search space, your
creativity, than it is your ability to properly path through that search
space. Therefore, I think you see a lot of great software come out of
America. Maybe not because they're better developers, but because they
might be more creative. Maybe they are more aware of what is possible
than someone that can just do the one thing that they are aware of well,
but fuck a lot of things up because the things that weren't specified
properly, they get done wildly wrong. But a creative person, as he's coding
it and doing it not perfectly, sees that it kind of isn't what you should have
wanted, and then lets you know, Hey, you shouldn't have wanted that, so
I'm going to build it differently. Thank me later.

The importance of feedback loops

Part of the reason that you should understand how important feedback
loop is the concept of the book The Design of Everyday Things written by
Mr. Norman, where good user interface, good usability, which is basically
another way of saying "human beings use it properly to the best of its
ability and enjoy doing so." That mandates two things: one, that the
available ways to use the thing are declared to you so that you can fuck
around with it and see which ways work, and which ways don't, and that's
the feedback loop. So the two core principles, and someone should check
to see if there's more, XX, are, declaring the options, using the options,
and having feedback that you can understand, whether what you just did
was good or not. Xx Paragraph hasn't been edited, meaning unclear

Synthesis

The important part is the synthesis, this is the highest and best application
of the human ability and spirit, to create something which has never
before existed and is excellent. Synthesis is the mental sex which
produces beautiful thought offspring.

Trichotomy

"A trichotomy is a three-way classificatory division. Some philosophers
pursued trichotomies." - Wikipedia

More at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotomy (philosophy)

Wavelenghts of creavitivity

If it's smart or effective to write drunk and edit sober, then it's possible
that certain types of thought have a frequency at which certain types of
mind states resonate those frequencies easier.

Maybe being tipsy restricts depth and enhances creativity in some ways.
Maybe being on downers does one thing, hallucinogens does one thing,
speed does another thing. It's therefore an interesting analogy to make
that thoughts are like freguencies, and that they resonate inside the



chambers of one's mind differently based on the shape, size and medium
of density of air inside the chamber. Not the real chamber, but, in theory,
the mind chamber of a person's mind.

To expand further upon that creativity idea, when you measure a speaker,
you have what are called Thiele- Small parameters, which measure the
electrical and mechanical residents, weight, electrical motor force,
magnet force, and if you have all those numbers, you can predict how that
driver, that speaker will act in an enclosure, and how it will respond to
frequencies, especially the musical kind. That type of Thiele-Small
parameterization could also exist amongst intelligent beings for searched
depth, searched width, how far do you go down a path before you decide
it's a dead end? How many paths do you try, what value do you give to
paths that seem related? I think a lot of Thiele-Small parameter speaker
optimization, Al and human creativity and idea searching are related.

Unique insights

For creativity exercises, you could try changing the color of your
environment, temperature, location, space, focus, posture or mind focus.
What part of your body are you focusing on? You could use archetype
experiments, where you pretend you're a king, pretend you're a poor
person, pretend you're angry, pretend you're happy, pretend you're all
kinds of different shit to get different perspectives on a thing. After doing
all that, maybe you'll have some new and unique insights that are still
your own.

Logic

Frameworks

Math

Great math learning reources

https://news.vcombinator.com/item?id=14161876
How the hell is math supposed to be useful to you? Is there a
shortage of people that know math? Can't wolframalpha.com
literally answer basically any question you properly type into it?

How are you supposed to profit off of some knowledge that is so
widespread and has been for thousands of years, and now is literally
done fast and instantly for free for anyone that has Internet access
and a browser? Is it important, yes, but only as it serves things that
are actually important. We need more people sticking parts
together with human ideas as the glue, let the grunts and machines
do the grunt work. Do what the machines can't. Be the middleware.
Xx advanced math? Basic math important in everyday life

Statistics and algebra are important for business and machine
learning

Frameworks and organizational structure

Who is better breastfeeding? The girl. Who is better at fist fight?
Well, probably the guy. Which one belongs on top? Nobody goes on
top. You're using the wrong framework. You're not supposed to
have a top and a bottom simplistic relationship organization



between utterly complex, utterly not simplistic things that have
been always changing, always evolving different and different
places relationship.

Looking on the other side of the coin

I've recently found more value than usual in looking in what is the
not thing. For instance, anytime you look at a question, you can
look at the not question. It's a little hard to explain, but I gave an
example of programming humans with something called frustration,
so that they halt what they are doing and go do another thing,
because otherwise they could just get stuck in a loop and keep
trying the thing until they died of hunger, their arms fell off, or
whatever other failure mode you hit. My example consisted of
several options. You could either get them to halt by hating what
they're doing, or by really liking the next thing, and from a
programming perspective it's much easier to hate the one thing you
have obviously in front of you, than to be drawn by the vastness of
everything else out there. It would be too hard to find a trigger in
the everything else out there to cause a halt.

Zoom out for first principals

Because chunking and nesting ideas is so powerful, it's super useful
to zoom out really far and make what you're looking at really small.
This way you get all these new little hook points you can anchor the
data to in your mind. It's sort of like seeing the forest as a forest
instead of only seeing lots of trees.

Advanced logic

Advanced practitioners of logic, and how to have the best grasp of logic
It's rather unfortunate that when you analyze some of the most
advanced practitioners of logic in the whole world, their lives kind of
suck. You take Wittgenstein, suicidal. Gay is derogatory, but it
definitely indicates some kind of off-programming from what's
normal. Hit kids, women, was a little bit violent towards kids if they
didn't get their math right. Changed his view on religion a couple
times, how does that happen? You either got it right or you don't,
you don't really switch between one stupid thing and another thing.

You even see other people, like Schopenhauer, who literally had to
come up with a logical framework to describe why he says that
aestheticism was great, but then he hoarded shit and was more
hedonistic. His excuse, his logic was that "to be a philosopher, you
need only build ideas, not be the ideas". You can sculpt a beautiful
sculpture without being beautiful, and you can be beautiful without
being a sculpture. That was a nice excuse, but most people, I think,
see that if you don't use what you claim to know and what you
claim is amazing, I think you greatly reduce the confidence in what
you're saying is true.

Just to give you an idea about how respected Wittgenstein was, he
actually was a student to Bertrand Russel. Bertrand Russel straight



up admitted his superiority and it basically changed his life when he
was talking to him and Wittgenstein criticized him, and at that
moment he knew he'd never be able to add to the science any
longer, because there was someone else who just had it better, and
what he was doing was kind of inaccurate compared to this other
guy's version of things. When you look at the productivity the guy
had, he only wrote a children's book, he released like three or four
things in his whole lifetime, and then, one of the most widely
regarded good things that ever came out of him had to come out of
his notes after he was dead.

To have the best grasp of logic, one of the best grasps of logic that
the world has ever seen in the history of mankind, and yet seemed
to execute logic in your own life so ineffectively, is, God. I guess it's
like football players; They're amazing at what they do, and then
their personal lives and their financial lives, they're definitely not.
Maybe there should be some other word for a person that
accurately uses what they know to the highest and best use and
outcome of its possibility. Maybe that's wisdom. I don't think
wisdom is enough. I mean, you never picture the wise person as
young, vital and fit, nor loved and popular. The wise person is
usually kind of alone, and not that powerful, but just knows what is
likely to happen if you do a certain thing.

I guess what Schopenhauer said was accurate. You can be an
amazing sculptor yet remain ugly, which is kind of a bad analogy
because using logic and building logic are very similar, whereas
looking pretty and sculpting have nothing in common. They don't
touch, they're not related. It's actually, that particular excuse that
Schopenhauer had for living a life at odds with what he taught is the
highest and best life you could live. I don't think it accurately
explained away his culpability or responsibility.

Correlation causation(More Info)

Correlation isn’t causation

More at: http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations
Illogical Pattern finding will lead you away from truth; Correlation causation

Education regarding correlation and causation - I remember the first time
that that was taught to me in a memorable way, and it was probably the
only thing I actually learned in college entirely. It was a trivia question that
my sociology teacher gave me. So, you're in a city, and one year the crime
rate of the city doubles and the number of people who attend church also
doubles, what can you say about what's going on in that city? A lot of
people would say that the new church goers are committing crimes. In
fact, wouldn't it be easier if you noticed that the population of the city
doubled as well? Therefore, really nothing ratio-wise changed. There were
twice as many church goers and twice as many crimes committed because
the population doubled.



Just because two things happen at the same time surely does not mean
that they caused one another. Being stumped for that moment and not
knowing what could have caused those two things to go up at the same
time really drove home the point that this third cause is always out there
and quite common. Two things that seem to be dependent on each other
are actually both caused by a third thing - appears all the time logically. I
believe that this serendipity feelings and pattern-finding feeling is yet
another effect of that third cause discovery that third causes are probably
much more common than we think they are.

Do not confuse correlation with causation

All the cool shit in the world that's the smartest shit in the world, you
don't understand, because it's the smartest shit in the world. It takes
people a lifetime of dedication and education to even get to
understanding the shit that's already out there to have the hopes of
building on top of it. It is an unfortunate consequence of confusing
causation with correlation that made up bullshit that has no value at all, is
also insanely complex. Unfortunately therefore, you are not able to
efficiently use the complexity of a topic to let you know whether it is
accurate or whether you should learn about it, or care about it. A lot of
people take something that's hard to understand, like quantum physics,
and try to use it outside of the realm where it is useful and apply to
emotions or feelings or business.


Reasoning

Critical thinking means judgmental thinking

Critical thinking isn't called critical because it's required, it just means
judgmental. This is the danger of words that have two meanings that are
very different. For instance, critical condition versus It's critical that you
do a thing.

How to catch Fraudulent statistics

" Benford's law : In any collection of statistics, a given statistic has roughly a
30% chance of starting with the digit 1."

Richard's comment: That's how you can catch fraudulent numbers being
generated by people instead of reality.

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of eponymous laws >

This is how you catch fakers of data.

Benford's law of controversy : Passion is inversely proportional to the
amount of real information available.

Avoid The Downsides to having just one innacurate idea

The downside to having one inaccurate idea is, if you believe that the
unborn have rights, it is pretty justifiable to go kill abortionists. It fucking
sucks! I don't really know of a way to disprove that idea. It's better to not
have the wrong idea in the first place. Unborn people are not people. It's






not everyone else's job to use all of their sperm and eggs to make you
happy Mr. Advisor guy. That guy just has to understand that the unborn
aren't people and do not have rights, and even if they did have rights and
they were being abridged, killing other people who have already been
born isn't the right solution. Christopher Hitchens quoted someone else
saying that For bad men to do bad things is quite simple, but to get a good
man to do bad things, you really need religion.

Calibrate your estimate on what you understand properly

The point being, if you are very good at knowing things, but very bad in
your estimates at what you understand or don't understand properly, you
will harm yourself; you will stop studying things that you should have
studied more and you will miseducate the world. On the other hand, if
you're super good at knowing what you know and what you don't know,
you'll probably actually also harm yourself because you'll be afraid to say
anything ever, because you're only comfortable speaking with an
unreasonable degree of specificity. You might be the kind of guy who's
incapable of suggesting what book someone reads because you're
deciding whether knowledge can even exist? How do we know what we
really know? Are we really just the simulation? You're too smart for your
own good. You've become ineffective.

Why is it that so much of the popular culture is influenced and created by
those that put their balls in their hands, get the job done and are willing
to be wrong? Because it's so important that you'd be better off getting an
80% right and eating shit 20% of the time than making no impact in the
world, only saying one thing once ever in your whole life, but being right
about it. Unfortunately, everyone else already knew that because the
guys that were 80% right already said it 50 times before you got around to
it.

Increasing your understanding removes limiting beliefs

The funny thing is, when you don't understand an idea good enough, you
think you know everything. Lots of 20-year olds think they know
everything. One time, when I was twenty, I thought I didn't have any
limiting beliefs. Turns out, my limiting belief was that I thought I didn't
have any limiting beliefs, and if I searched harder, I had the belief that
being chubby was okay.

Your capacity to understand complex things; The truly hardest take

dedication/time/emotion

In a world where intelligences and interests fit on a nice bell curve, the
vast majority of people don't even have the capacity to understand the
hardest things. Of those that do, the truly hardest things take more than
capacity, they take the dedication of time and emotion to excel at. You




can't be too good at too many things, you run out of time, you really only
have time to be a master of a few things. Thus, the vast majority of people
will have many false beliefs about many things, not because they're
stupid, or malicious, but because life is hard. When you have to hand over
your decision making to experts, because they're the only ones with a
hope of being right, then whether you are correct or not basically comes
down to whether you chose to believe the right expert or not. This is a
choice that the super intelligent must make very similar to those less
intelligent, we all must defer to the experts on tons and tons of things
every day.

Capture the prerequisites for bigger and better understanding

The ability for someone to understand a great idea unfortunately is tied to
the ability to have created the idea on their own. Similar to the way that
burgers can't get much better because were limited by our taste buds, it's
the same reason that you can share something amazing with them, but
they don't have the tools to understand why they should be amazed.

Human Intellect has not changed, knowledge transfer has just increased in

quality

It sucks when you read reports and documents from 100 or 1000 years
ago and you could believe they were written today. The people of the
time had such sharp minds and such thinking abilities that it's a tragedy
they didn't have access to the same tools and resources we have today. If
the biologists are right, the capacity of the human mind hasn't really
increased very much at all in the couple of thousand years since English
and cities have existed. It's quite a wonder to believe that what separates
us from them isn't that we are better people, but that we have stored so
much energy in knowledge passed down from generation to generation
that the lives we live today are massively better than the lives they lived,
and it's not because we are smarter!

Analogies are the best tools for understanding - Use them!

It is said that analogy is the most powerful of all learning tools. Analogy is
where you take new ideas and show how they're just like other things;
glove is to hand like sock is to foot, square is to cube like circle is to
cylinder.

Regardless of all those differences, because you understand the concept
of a door, you can really quickly understand and operate all of these,
why? Because analogies are awesome. They're all different in ways that
don't really matter, and similar in the ways that they need to be for you to
kick ass at them. By the way, it's common to see analogies as large
components of IQ tests. Therefore, if finding and using analogies is
something you can get better at, then you will show a heightened IQ score
on many IQ tests. You'll probably be better off with a heightened
understanding of the world, than yet another test score to brag about, but
it's a free bonus to an otherwise already awesome behavior.



The power of analogy; the more you understand about the world in one
area, the more you understand about the world in all the other areas, as
long as you learn how to apply the analogy, as long as you learn how to
apply the framework somewhere else. It may not increase what they call
in the study of intelligence, your Big G, your general intelligence, how well
you do on an IQ test, but you can have Big G without ever learning a
language. You can have Big G in intelligence without ever learning how to
do anything.

Less complicated ways that lead to understanding

If you want to learn how to speed read and speed understand, then
you're studying common patterns that you can apply other places to
employ the power of analogy. You're using tools that shift the words in
front of your eyes so that you don't have to move your eyes. Those things
are proven to work. Everything else that you study to try and "teach you
to speed read," they actually just make you think you understand more,
but in reality you're smoking through the pages reading a lot faster, not
absorbing a lot faster, basically throwing more information in the garbage,
but at the end of throwing all that information in the garbage, you think
you know better than you did. Then, they test it. I've said it again and I'll
say it here now, the world does not need speed reading. The world needs
speed understanding. Since understanding isn't something that happens
better faster, increasing the speed at which we understand things isn't the
right solution. Doing an inferior method of understanding faster is crap
compared to doing a better way of understanding, which is faster, not
because you're doing it faster, but faster because it is a better analogy, a
better example, a simpler, less complicated way of understanding a thing.

I'll give an example. If you say that the burden of proof lies with the
person that makes the outrageous statement, well that's one way of
understanding, that's a good way to understand the world. The simpler
thing is more likely to be accurate than the more complex thing, because
it involves less moving parts to make it happen. If both of those two
explanations, the more complicated and the less complicated one, both
accurately define the way a thing can happen, the less complicated one's
more likely. It's a little bit esoteric, it's a little bit hard to understand.

Another guy comes along, Bertrand Russell, and he has a funny little
saying called Bertrand's tea kettle. What's that? He says, listen. I could say
that between us and the moon, or us and the sun, orbiting, is a tea kettle.
And if you can't disprove that, then we'll just have to take my assumption
that it exists. It's an example of proof through absurdity

I'm not sure how this fits, but you could say it's the power of analogy.
When I said that when you learn martial arts that there are certain moves
where you miss a couple frames, you're weak from a couple frames. You
would only know about how many frames a move costs you if you've
studied fighting video games. When you design such game and you give
each character a certain set of moves that he can do, it's like a giant



abstraction on top of the game Rock-paper-scissors; this move beats that
move, and then you've got timing relationships. If you try to charge up
one move, then you're weak for another one for this period of time. You
can, though, bate someone to try and take advantage of that weakens,
and then take another action to counter it.

Understanding that executing ideas or businesses or punches or kicks,
they take an amount of time to execute. They, unless you're a perfect
fighter, people can tell through your stance, timing and what you do with
your eyes and where you put your weight, what you might throw. This is
because they've seen it before. Whatever decisions you make in life -
education, fighting, you're going to have down time, you're going to be
telegraphing your intention to people that are watching. Let's say you
want to bid on a couch, and you tell everyone in the room what you're
willing to pay. You just kind of screwed yourself on the price. Let's say you
want to buy one whole street of real estate to go tear the things down
and build a bigger piece of real estate, and you don't hide the fact that
you're buying up piece by piece. If one of the people finds out that that's
what you're trying to do, they can ask you for a whole crap load more
than their house would be by itself, because their house is now a
requirement for you to complete your set that you've already invested so
much into. They can charge you double or triple the market value of their
house, because you need it and it's worth the double or triple to you,
solely because they were aware of your intention.

Visual Diagrams for understanding can hurt you

The reasons that the vast majority of things that you learn in school and
work with and use in your day-to- day life, you never end up referencing
in some cool geometric, like formula or intelligence. If you're watching
your macros as a guy that works out, do you actually reference the food
pyramid, never you have the macros just memorized. If you're doing
math, do you ever go back and look at the unit circle to decide how to do
your calculus - fucking never. These contrivances of people thinking that
some triangle or pyramid might add to people's understanding in my
belief hurts people's understanding

Using the wrong visualisations screws up our understanding of ideas
Serial Pyramid Pillars Totem pole instead of pyramids. Pyramids
indicate volume difference. <TJ-XX - Could use an example about
Maslow's, unless that's already somewhere>

We are pattern finding machines - Let's make use of it

We create patterns - that's what music is, that's what language is. When a
man makes love to a woman, and that woman has a beautiful child, that's
a new pattern that we created, not totally consciously. Maybe parts of it,
but we choose those traits, we chose that time, we chose to give
ourselves fully to another person. That's where cool people like us come
from. We're built to absorb, process and create virtual realities that may
come true in our head. That's what dreaming is, that's what imagination



is, that what play is. It is us, getting the best real world practice we can
get, without greatly endangering our lives. If you want to have the virtual,
I'm being chased by a killer - experience, you need only wait. It happens a
couple of dreams that you'll remember a year. I'm not sure the rate that
you get to have your escape the killer - dreams, but they're useful. If ever
one day a killer's actually chasing you, you will do slightly better, because
you've already pre-calculated some shit that guy might do, and some shit
that you might do. We arrive at those paths, quicker. It's pre-
computation. I think it's where Deja-vu comes from. I think when you
have a Deja-vu, you accidentally have something happen in your real life,
something that you pre-complied in your sleep or in your free time, or you
subconsciously saw in a film or subconsciously imagined happened to
somebody else and then it just brought back that memory of Oh fuck, I've
seen this before!

How religions emerge

If you put a kid on an island, he'll invent his own religion

If you take a kid, as soon as he's born, you put it and a robot on an
island, the robot feeds it until it can handle life on its own, never
talks to it, never teaches it anything, that kid is going to find
patterns. This is because pattern finding is useful, and those
patterns will probably turn into stories. If it ever meets another
person, it will tell those stories, and then the opportunity for
collectivism and collective benefit and teamwork will exist. The
people that believe the same stories will group together and
outperform people that don't believe the same shared fictions.

Thus, it's not that religions are inherited, it's that religions, in
isolation, would emerge for the same profitable reasons that they
always have, because pattern recognition is useful, memory and
therefore storytelling is useful, and working together is useful.
Learning and transmitting knowledge to another person, is done
through story - the story of imaginary futures.

Instructing is taking a pattern found to work, and sticking it in someone
else’s head

What is instructing? If you imagine a world that doesn't actually
exist and we just stick it in your head, then in that other alternate
world that you can say is current or past, whatever, it doesn't abide
by the rules of time because it doesn't really exist. It only exists in
your mind.

That same pattern finding, storytelling and collective profit will
cause religions to emerge, because the access time and processing
required to generate a fucked up story that is cool to tell, cool to
share, and cool to collect behind, is a much lower bar and standard
than something that we haven't even been able to find with all of
our advanced technology, which is a cool, compelling, easy to tell,
to collect behind, and factually, scientifically accurate and true



story. We've got a lot of cool stories everyone believes. They're all
wrong and mutually exclusive. Even if by chance, one of them was
actually right, all the other ones are still wrong. The vast majority of
religious and spiritual stories that everyone tells are wrong by their
own definitions without any other research whatsoever, because
they disagree with each other. Whichever one's right, all the other
ones are wrong.

The threshold that pattern recognition, storytelling and collectivism
emerges in the behavior of wrong beliefs is like a hundred times
lower than something we've not even found yet. Science hasn't
become a religion at all. Nobody goes to science school on Sunday
and prays to the Science God and bangs only other science¬
following chicks. It's not a thing. That's why even if you find
something that works, if you don't have all the other cool stories
and side benefits to believing it, it can't compete with religions.

I guess the closest we have to that is Judaism, literally. You're a
doctor, you're a scientist, okay, we're cool with you hooking up with
our daughter. Not a doctor? Eh, not a lawyer? Maybe you're not
what we want for our daughter. Culturally, the Jewish people
reward saving, investment, learning. Other cultures reward
adventure, craziness, drinking, partying, shit that is the opposite of
investment. You're investing in the death of your liver, which isn’t
really a good investment. What did your liver ever do to you?

Except trying to keep you healthy.

My point is, emergent properties exist, and they're not often
inherited. They would re-execute in a very similar form on their
own, because they pay profits, and the threshold of things that have
to align in order for them to emerge is so vastly lower than the
other things that we're trying to force to emerge by design. This is
why if you got rid of all the religions in the world, they would just
reappear in slightly different forms, because they provide a
competitive advantage to their followers.

The set of things that you could misunderstand, the set of ways that
you could misunderstand a thing, is nearly infinite compared to the
very small set of ways that you could actually understand the way
that it really is. And the way that it is really, wildly not, the million
other ways that it could be, but isn't.

Don't fall for correlation causation fallacy, improve your understanding and

reasoning

The older you get, the more things you see and have seen, the easier it is
for you to make connections. As a result, the easier it is for you to see
connections where they don't really exist, or where they do exist, they
don't exist in the way that you wish they did. You find some interesting



coincidence. Let's say you Google one topic, and then you're going
through the day and you Google something else, and then those two
things somehow magically both relate to a third thing. What you'll find
more often than not is that the reason that those two seemingly so
distantly related topics actually relate is all because of you - the thing that
influenced the first result, the thing that influenced the second result, and
the thing that influenced you - were all quite popular and were pre¬
selected for popularity.

In summary, what you'll find is that you'll have more of these feelings of
serendipity the more you use Google or voice recognition. I had a friend
that one time, and she spoke tongues into her phone and her phone gave
her very interesting, accurate results because she didn't realize that the
phone didn't have a choice. The phone was going to give the best guess
no matter what, and the best guess is always going to give you good
results. I, to teach her the error of her ways, the error that she thought
that there was meaning coming from the phone even though she was
speaking gibberish into it, I spoke gibberish into it, and it also gave me
meaningful results, because it had no choice but to give meaningful
results. We were the ones that tried to pretend that the meaning came
from what we said. In reality, the meaning came from random chance.
Some meaning had to be output, and we were the ones making the
connection between those two meanings - the gibberish being spoken
into the phone and the interesting, unique outcome coming out the other
side. Therefore, the more intelligent you are and the better story teller
you are, the more connections you can make, the more believable you
can make these false correlations that have no causation.

Knowing Thyself

Do not assume the world is as wise as you are

It’s hard to know reality, could you predict ISIS? You must not assume the
world is as wise as you, it’s not.

Know what you know, and what you don't. Know the same of others.

I think the Monty Hall problem and the statistics example in that ted talk I
saw regarding rolling a dice I think, where everyone answers it wrong are
very telling^^^^^^^^^^^|. if everyone is working on wrong data
and or everyone is making the wrong decisions consistently, you can't
really expect great output from persons under that influence, at least in
regards to that material. There's merit in tying that lack of knowledge in
to understanding oneself and having some humility.

Find out your goals and the things in life that motivate you

A lot of times being a good teacher doesn't mean that you are a good do¬
er, and vice versa. They are different skillsets, being able to do something



and being subconsciously competent at it doesn't make you a good
teacher. Being a good teacher requires pedagogic skills that have very
little to do with, for instance, swimming, and that’s why even if you're an
Olympic winner, you might make a shitty coach. By definition
subconscious competence means you are quite probably a shit teacher
about it, because it's subconscious to you! Because you don't know why
you're good at racecar driving, you don't know why you're good at stick,
you don't know why you are a good speaker, and to know those things
would be an entirely different skillset. Self-knowledge and self-awareness,
and proper education and motivation is an entirely separate domain, and
taught as such from being a good business man, or being a good
basketball player. A coach that can help you meet goals, and refine your
objectives, and find the golden moving feeling that motivates you in a
thing, it works in a lot of places. If you can sell one thing, you can sell
anything. Maybe it was compelled when they saw someone winning a
competition, maybe they could feel it when they felt jealous that
someone else was achieving something.

Memory

The organizing of all important things

The world is a super complicated place. You can’t listen to all the songs at
once, even radios listen to only a few stations at a time. We have such a
hard time keeping ideas in our minds that we even split 10 digit phone
numbers into two sets.

That’s why it helps to keep things in easy to remember groups, and then
nest the groups in each other, deeper and deeper. Remember that overly
simple understanding is more dangerous than overly complex. Overly
complex might take a long time to digest, but overly simply and you might
never discover you were missing important parts of understanding stuff
they used to think back when we didn't know as much about the world.
Just these types of images and phrenology images, this secondary
consciousness shit is stuff we just learned rather recently.

Dont become a memorizing machine or rely on your memory

It's funny when I tell you that you shouldn't become a memorizing
machine because we have phones, computers and other people that do
that very least important of all metal abilities. At least, past the working
memory. Working memory, you need it to build new ideas in your head,
but actually memory of facts and figures and things like that, that you
don't need to instantly have. Working memory, that memory is crap
Mnemonic technique - USE IT






When you interrogate people with good memories, or that have
exception reasoning abilities, you find these common patterns of brain
usage that are not chemical. They are conscience decisions to use your
brain in a certain way, and then after you use it that way enough, you're
just used to using it that way. Mnemonic technique exists, chunking exists.
Making up funny little sayings with the first letter as something you want
to remember, acronyms, they work. Mary Jane eats many jam sandwiches
under Ned's porch, that's the planets in order of the sun. If it is true, that
the smartest, most effective, most bad ass, non-idiot savant fucking
people, all have little fun tricks and shortcuts they use to make their mind
work better. Wouldn't that be a good thing to teach people. Wouldn't that
be a good thing to teach people? Wouldn't that be something that could
pay dividends forever more? I really think it would be. What do you know,
mnemonic technique has existed for thousands of years

Using mnemonic technique lets you now what's important so you can take

action

A mnemonic technique that I use is putting shit in alphabetical order when
I meet people. If I meet some new people, I memorize their names by
putting them in my mind and preferably in the real world in the order of
their names. A mnemonic technique is knowing, and a mnemonic
technique is having desire. If you have desire, it instantly lets you know
what is important and what is not. Knowing what is important, makes
your memory happy as fuck. Super easy to remember what you care
about! If you love sports, it's super easy to remember stats. If you love
gadgets, it's super easy to remember stats. If you love books, it's super
easy to remember a thing you read in a book. People love to remember
shit that interests them. If you are passionless and driveless, and have no
desires, well then, how is your brain supposed to know what to put a big
ass red flag next to, to remember? How is it supposed to know what's
important to you, if you don't tell it, if you don't mention it, if you don't
let it feel it?

Using mnemonic techniques to make better sense and reduce mental overhead
As I mentioned earlier, the world does not need speed reading, it needs
understanding. Speed reading is by definition the opposite of
understanding. You're increasing the rate of the data transfer and
decreasing the horse power available to organize and understand the
data; very likely, what you're doing is wasting your fucking time. Now, if
you want to get a book over with really quick, you can skip the speed
reading and just look at the table of contents and pretend that you learn
something from that.

Here's the problem, for some reason, most people's table of contents are
fucking useless! I don't know who invented this in books lately, where you
try and make the table of contents so vague so as to be only useful for
someone that has actually completed reading the whole book so that they
can translate your shitty vague chapter title into something actually
meaningful. That sir, I hope, does not follow the guidelines of good style
issued by the associated press, and I hope it doesn't also issue the good



elements of styles advertised by Strunk & White. One of the most
prescribed for reading books in the college syllabuses of the world, it's like
number three or four most commonly required reading material in the
syllabus of easily digitized and search colleges. Why do I mention this to
you? One, for you guys out there writing, please stop wasting people's
time with fake tables of contents that don't describe the contents. That's
like going to a supermarket and then no longer categorizing things by
what they really are, and randomizing where things go. Oh, you want
Colgate toothpaste? It's next to the milk. Or, Crest toothpaste! It's hidden
inside the toilet cleaner section. Wouldn't that suck? Good categorization,
good description and good mnemonic technique is what human beings
need to make sense of this ever more complicated and changing world.

Invent more words to spread better understanding

Inventing words is cool. It’s one of those things where it’s hard to get
traction at first and once you do get the traction, you get explosive
results. It’s like a diet. If your new diet doesn't become popular, you don't
have much impact, but if your diet does become popular, holy shit, you're
going to change the eating habits of a huge portion of the planet for the
period of time where that little fad diet was fad full. That's a funny word,
fad full. Thus, if you coin new terms and have the balls and the influence
to get them to stick, you bring into the global consciousness an easier
path to execution for that thing. For instance, there was a time where the
term branding didn't exist, and then people figured out that it was
something that worked, it was good to do. They assigned it a word and
holy shit, the branding thing is now all over the place.

You're going to find that with all kinds of human behavior. Like, feeling the
burn. What's feeling the burn? Oh, that's when you work out real hard
and your muscles feel like their hot. Oh, feeling the burn! That sounds
good, I like that. Now, people are much more likely to work out until they
feel a burn. So, by coining terms and pushing them to stickiness, if they
can be made to be sticky. It helps to have them sound nice, feel nice, be
imaginative, have those little hooks that make moronic techniques work.
Then, you can for the rest of human endeavor and for the rest of human
time as long as that word is used, influence greatly the actions that people
take. I'm a big proponent of taking what is true and commonly known
these days, but no one fucking uses it, because there's no word for the
simple actionable action, and malign a word for it in the hopes that
people then actually do the thing they know of. Everyone knows that
science exists, but no one god damn does it. If we can start to take little
chunks of usefulness out of it, which is science, then people can get the
advantages of doing them.

A way to look at life choices

It's interesting to me that it seems like I learned through hearing this term
frames. How many frames it costs you to try and use a move in a game?
With that understanding, I was able to extrapolate it to business and
purchasing, and to choices that you make in your life, and to other
systems that have feedback, that change based on what you do, just like



the fighting game. There's another person looking at the same screen
you're looking at, who's trying to figure out what you're going to do, why
you're going to do it, anticipate you, manipulate you, and win. In a
fighting game, it's very clear what the goal is: to get rid of the other guy's
health bar. You win. You have health, he doesn't have health. You win the
round, win all the rounds. In the real world, it becomes slightly less clear,
because everyone's got different goals. Some people want to be loved,
some people want to have adventure, some people want to have all the
power they can have. Some people just want to be at peace. Some people
don't want to be here at all, they can't wait to get off this trip. They kill
themselves. Everyone in this world has a completely different set of
responses that are kind of hard to predict, hard-ish.

I love it in life when things are similar to something else, because if you
understand the first thing, you now nearly instantly understand the next
things, and all other things like it that you ever see again. Take doors, for
instance. Every single door that you meet is very different from the last.
Some push open, some pull, and some are bi-curious. Some are even split
in the middle and just the top can be opened, some are revolving doors.
They're made of wood, glass, metal, you name it. They even lock in all
kinds of different ways, a safe door is probably one of the coolest looking
doors.

Make cool sayings to ease understanding of ideas & name patterns

You can find the disappearing middle for a logical fallacy. All these
examples we have of parable and easy to understand sayings, makes
understanding complicated stuff a hell of a lot easier, because if you
didn't have those cool sayings, you might never understand the idea.
Some things are hard to understand.

When you name a pattern, it's easier to recognize it and use it in the
future.

Anthropomorphizing ideas is effective

I like to turn a lot of ideas into people, because people are used to dealing
with people.


Thinking

Getting the best out of your brain processing power

I wanted to tell you about this specific subreddit (a discussion forum to a
specific subject on reddit.com) called shower thoughts, and why they're
important. I ended up giving dissertation on the effects of groups
collaborating and the evolution of their environments on the Internet.

Shower thoughts - how odd is it, that the most resonant name for the idea
of unique things you think of is shower thoughts? Why is it that these
things occur so often in the shower and so rarely in other places? My
theory is that we have a whole lot of great processing power in these
great brains of ours, and that somewhere along the line one of our great
ancestors someone started running their brain constantly. Instead of only



solving problems that were readily apparent, they started solving
problems that didn't exist yet. In the animal world, that is basically what
play is, you're getting the training and practice that you need, without
having to risk your life to get it. That's what imagination and deep thought
is for human beings. It's our version of animal play, it's what makes us
more effective when the time comes, and often we can even create the
time where our creative thinking will pay off. It's not just the outcome
from the environment, i.e. we change our environment to suit us more
often that we change ourselves to match our environment. I know I'm not
wiping my ass with leaves :)

Wouldn't it be a waste to take the massively powerful and creative
machine that is the human mind, and have it only run half the time,
instead of all the time? This is how I feel about meditation. If you have to
take your engine apart after every race, or if you need to clear your mind
or recharge your batteries, use your mind better in the first place? The
concept that by forcefully overcoming my well-evolved desire to be
curious and think constantly, and artificially imposing a blank and empty
mind on myself, will somehow cause me to be more effective in my up
time.

It's a similar, but perhaps smaller risk, with all this mind experimentation
crap. Perhaps some cult really has all the answers you want, should you
go try all the cults? How about all the religions? What about all the mind
altering substances? I heard that Francis Crick was on LSD when he
discovered DNA. If I had to bet my life, I'm going to tell you that the vast
majority of discoveries have been made by people not on LSD. Perhaps
LSD will change your perspective on life, and perhaps you will see a thing
in a way you never would have any other way. Perhaps it would work out
well for you, or not. Perhaps you'll get the same results the vast majority
of all other drug users are getting, a change in feeling and perception,
without a big increase in performance. It's probably unlikely that you
would happen to run into a cult of really drugged up dudes crushing it in
the business world or crushing it in the stock market etc.

Problem Solving

Use your Intelligence to overcome human problems
Modern human adaption using intelligence

How could we reconcile this tragedy of being ideally suited for the
world that no longer exists? Do you know how we can best use our
intellect to overcome these problems in the same way as we did to
surmount all the other problems the humanity was facing? For the
last hundred thousand years a life for a human being has been
brutal, short and painful, there was no need for you to leave your
neighborhood, learn new languages and find out why the hell
something happened. Your teeth fell out, and there were all kinds of
bad things, now it's better.

Don't solve problems you don't have



Don't solve problems you don't have. Every problem you solve that you
don't have means it's a fucking problem you ignored that you do have.
Take the limited time that you have and spend it on what is here and what
actually matters. Don't be a fucking philosopher that learns how to solve
the world's problems that aren't yours.

Solve problems and adjust your frustration

The whole world is spending all their money to learn something. The
reason I got on that tangent was, why is that you can make money fixing
people's phones, why is it that they don't just spend the hours to do it
themselves? Because their brains have been programmed to disengage in
activity because that activity might be very valueless compared to some
other activity. They get frustrated very quickly, they get frustrated very
easily, because 1,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago when the Earth's
psychology was evolving and deciding which a better strategy was, some
people got frustrated more easily, some people got frustrated less easily.
Back then, in those environments, the problems that you had to solve
were much simpler. You would see much more profit by getting frustrated
easier, because an alternative, sideways solution would be much closer at
hand. Your range of problem solving abilities was a lot wider when the
complexity is reduced. Every layer of complexity that you include
decreases your problem solving abilities. If you're creating software, you
can't be off by a comma, you can't be off by a period, you can't be off by a
bracket versus a parenthesis

Solve today's problems

Solving the problems of the future that doesn't yet exist. What kind of
clothes will I wear when I'm the world's strongest man? Don't waste your
time, you are not going to be the world's strongest man. Don't be
shopping for giant clothes. What are you going to do with all your riches?
Which island are you going to buy? Don't waste your time - you are not
buying any islands. Solve today's problems, and the funny thing is that by
solving today's problems, you are more likely to end up with the which
island to buy problem, but by solving that which island to buy problem
now you won't ever get the privilege of having the problem. A lot of times
in life to be effective, basically all the time, you've got to solve the
questions that are today's problem to earn the right to have tomorrow's
problem. Worry about today's problem. Don't sacrifice today's
effectiveness for the dream of tomorrow's effectiveness, because you
could be optimizing for the wrong shit, you could be optimizing for a
reality that will never happen.

Don't solve what others think are problems, but what you think are problems
I used to be of the mindset of profitability and solving problems for
money, using other people's problems to relief pin points, find profit and
have correct action over incorrect action. The problem with that old style
belief is that your paths in life are restricted to what other people think
are their problems. The problem with what other people think are their
problems is that they use their beliefs and their values to decide what
their problems are and half the time, their beliefs and values are fucked
up. Now, you're trapped in doing fucked up things in your life, because



you think you're relieving pain, you think you're solving problems. You
are, but those people shouldn't have had that pain and those problems if
they used their brains better in the first place. Most people that want help
with a problem, have actually misidentified what the actual problem is,
and think they have a problem planning, when they have a problem doing.

A much higher, better use of your intellectual abilities, business talents,
talents of any form are to not solve what other people think are problems,
but to solve what you think are problems, assuming that you're smarter
than they are and have better beliefs.

Don’t live your life cockblocking people's ideas or solving the problems of others
Another good way to look at that is, if you ask people when what they
would prefer when the car came out, they'd prefer a better horse. They
don't want a fucking car, they wanted a better horse. The same happens if
you ask the people that wrote the laws for airplanes, what kind of laws
they should have. They have laws for boats, and because airplanes were
so new, they had stupid laws that said you had to have lifeboats on the
airplane. It took time for the law to catch up with reality.

My point is, don't live your life cock blocking other people's ideas. If you
think about the problems of others, or judge the rightness or wrongness
of their ideas, you are but a mirror of their thoughts. That causes you to
neglect your own ideas and restrict your creativity, if you are only a
reflection of someone or something. Let them react to you by advertising
your own truth instead of negating their statements and falling into their
framing of the world. Don't live your life as a cock blocker of ideas and
don't live your life as a problem solver of other people's problems,
because you will be restricted by what problems they think matter and
what they're aware of.

Solve the problems people are unaware of

You think Steve Jobs invented the iPhone because people were dying for
something that didn't have any buttons? No, they would have probably
told you that things without buttons were stupid. How would you dial it in
the dark? How would you dial it if the screen got wet? And so on. Now,
everything that we have that's the best of class device has one, two or
three buttons and no more. You would have never gotten to that
conclusion and created that invention if you were focused on solving
other people's problems that they were aware of. You need to be focused
on the problems that they're unaware of. That means creative individual
production and thought, not mindless group think focused by the
constraints of the idiots of the world that you're forced to interact with.
Troubleshooting is hard, you need to acquire experience solving real world
problems

Lots of people don’t know much of shit about problem solving, or
how easy it is to make the wrong call on the solution to a problem,
because they haven't actually had much experience solving real
world problems. In the real world, when you encounter a problem,



that problem could be caused by 5-10 different things. Even when
you go one by one and try to eliminate the potential causes, you run
into fun ones, where things fail only some of the time, but work
other times, intermittence guess you could call them. Another
possibility is that you get two intermittent problems at the same
time, so when you implement a fix, it works sometimes and not
others. Or, the solution to your original problem causes a new one,
or the test you just did to see if your guess was right, actually was
right, but you can't tell because you just broke something else
during the test. Now, you actually have two broken things if you
revert your fix.

Intermittant problems

There's three things worse than an intermittent problem when you're
trouble shooting, because what would solve the problem, doesn't.
Therefore you think it's not a solution because the normal failure state
isn't occurring when you're trying to implement that solution.

Let's get a better understanding on troubleshooting the human body

If you want to know how poorly we understand what's going on in the
human body, guess how they test to see how much pain you're in? They
literally put a picture of a drawn face of a facial expression and then they
assume that that facial expression equals your facial expression.

Therefore, you're in whatever amount of pain the drawing is in. That is
pretty sad.

It's probably a better way with FMRI (Functional magnetic resonance
imaging), but I do know that this is a lot cheaper, and easier, and faster to
use, than an FMRI.

Fixing things in the real world can actually be pretty tough. All these
complicated issues I'm telling you about are actually easy, because at least
you have a decent list in your mind that is finite of how many potential
causes for the failure there could really be. What do you do when you
don't even understand the system well enough to know the complete list
of ways that the thing could be broken? This is where we are at with the
human body. We can barely tell what is going on in there, we have a
pitiful understanding of what really happens inside cells, and for the most
part, we are just a giant organization of lots of cells. Think about how
limited our diagnostic tools are to try and even guess what's going on. We
can stick a stethoscope on your chest and listen to your heart for a little
bit, we can try to hear the sound your lungs make when breathing, we can
check your pulse rate and your blood pressure at a single instance in time.
This is definitely not rocket science. Maybe we can extend the amount of
time we measure and the rate we sample, maybe that is a little better.
Now, what are all the things we can't see in real time? Hormone levels,
oxygen levels, blood composition, how many different kinds of cells are in
there, and so on. There's really not too much we can tell in a reasonable
time frame at all, and most of it requires drawing blood, which puts extra
load on your body, because you need to replace that blood. You can only



do so much of that. Literally some of our required diagnostics require us
shoving fingers or overly large cameras up your ass.

If having another person's fingers up your ass isn't your kind of party, it's
probably a good indication that our tools for telling what's going on in a
patient's body are pretty shitty, pardon the pun.

If you've not banged your head against the wall for a couple years solving
hard problems, your suggestions for solutions might be pretty poor.


Mind maps suck

Tony Buzan and the creating of the concept of the mind map and trying to profit off it - it
was an idea of a guy who built an idea that sucks and doesn't work and makes the world a
worse place, but somehow gives you the hope that it will work out and waste a lot of
people's time. Xx Explain more about mind map

Mind mapping is garbage

If it was a good way to organize data, books would come as fold out mind map
posters. It really sucks. Because nature is disorganized doesn't mean disorganization is
a goal. It's the opposite of organization. If you thought spitting out ideas linked to
other ideas in a star shaped format was good, because it was "organic" then why
wouldn't you make it 3 dimensional and rotatable like the real world? Or perhaps
have a floor like the real world? Since you like nature so much, hell lets have wild
animals piss on your mind map, and let a hurricane blow it apart too.

Ever try to find a house in a neighborhood with streets that are organic and curved
instead of lines in a grid? It's a nightmare. Straight lines beat "organic" squiggly lines.

Decisions

Decision

Knowing lots of things is very different from being able to make good decisions about
things. You could say that knowing how to make good decisions should be the first
thing you learn, and know, for it will greatly enhance your performance on all other
things you will ever learn. Just like learning to read and speak are great first steps
down the path of knowledge, so should learning to think well be the third step just
after speaking and reading.

Flip a coin, if you feel the urge to flip it again, you've already decided.

Analysis paralysis

If you want to chop down a forest, you don't stare at it trying to figure out how all the trees
are related to each other, and putting them in order. You just walk up to the first tree that
you want to cut down, and start chopping. There's a joy in not understanding an entire
problem, and just getting to work. Like writing a book. It would be harder to predict what
the book would look like, than it would be to just write the book. Making accurate





predictions is really hard. Thus, when a problem is complicated enough, you can be better
off just doing the things you know you need to do no matter what, and while you're doing
them, your subconscious will be working on guessing what the future will look like.

Most people don't have an understanding problem, they have a motivation problem. They
think their understanding and their plans aren't good enough, so they don't do them, not
knowing that many of the best things in the world started with terrible plans, and just
changed along the way into something great. In business they call it pivoting. When your
first plan doesn't work, you do a different plan.

This is similar to the pottery teacher who split her class into two. One half of the class
would be graded on a single piece at the end of the semester and the other half of the class
would just be graded by the pound. It was an experiment showing the difference between
being very productive, and being thoughtful, and then just a burst of productive much later
on. The quality of the people that produced by the pound was better than the quality of the
people that thought a lot and built a single work.

Building things and evolving them beats thinking too much, and building at the last minute,
if ever.

Avoid Fallacies

Russel's Teapot. Clarity can be achieved in different ways

Russel's Teapot is proof that even if something is already present in the logical canon
and education, that a great and visual analogy relying on absurdity can be so useful
and widely quoted as to become the primary name and reference for the example.
Clarity and brevity matter greatly in all things of the mind. It's basically an easier to
understand version of Argument from ignorance.

Proximity Fallacy, Avoid being mislead

There's this logical fallacy of a thing near a thing gets influenced by the thing. Michael
Jordan wears Nike's, therefore he’s associated with Nike's. He's great, therefore
Nike's must be great. That's because human beings' brains don't work that great. I can
list you some other great people associated with some bullshit things, and just
because someone is associated with a thing doesn't mean that thing is rubbed off on
them. The reason I mention this is because it's a tactic of association by proximity,
which is something we're going to try and do by helping our readers achieve
everything that they want in life and trying to get them to take their own survival into
their own hands, which is not something they would have bought a book on from the
get-go.

Descriptive names for fallacies are useful for future avoidance

Lots of fallacies have easy to remember and useful names, for instance, the
disappearing middle, the slippery slope, the straw man. You have an idea.

It's really hard to make use of the framing fallacy, because you don't know when to
apply it. If you know the framing fallacy exists when you use framing to make two
things that are equal seem different, you only know that the fallacy exists, if you




already know that the two things are fucking equal. If you don't know the two things
are equal, because you're already having the fallacy executed upon you, they seem
wildly different. You can't make use of knowing about the fallacy, because you never
know when to trigger your knowledge of it existing, because you would only know by
seeing the quality of two things, and you can't judge their quality without already
knowing that you are in the fallacy. Basically, because you're in the shit, you can't tell
you're in the shit.

Much of the fallacy of the unqualified percentage. I think people don't understand
how shitty increased crime is unless you get them to see it linearly. You say, "Listen,
because the crime rate is this in this place, or as it is here, 100 or 200 or 100,000 extra
people have to get fucked because of that." Then, you show the linear actual fucking
that occurs instead of just saying some percentage that doesn't have a face.

Do not let mental illusions mislead you

I’ve not seen this one described before

Dissymmetry of lObto 100 to 10 invest 1000 percent 90 percent Xx Clarification

Small discount, large increase equivalence, unqualified percentage

Xx I think the language used should be "increases look larger than discounts", because
look indicates the misperception.

If I make a new logical description for this common error of using a percentage when a
flat rate may better serve, "30% discount is always equal to a 50% increase", well then
you could use language that say "small discount equals large increase". No one really
knows what framing is. It's like what you do to a door. It's a pretty big mental jump for
people to understand the meta context of the way an argument is structured.
Otherwise I already know all the fucking fallacies. I would have identified the fallacy
on site. I'm pretty much a fallacy expert and I didn't notice the thing. iies-ds



There should be two different fallacies that should be described. One is called the
unqualified percentage. You say that you doubled your sales? So what? What does
that mean qualitatively, you went from one to two? Don't tell me half the story, the
misleading half. Oh, you know, we ramp up our customers 25% every month, but how
many customers do you have? Two? The other fallacy is that discounts are always
smaller than increases, and so a 33% discount is really a 50% increase in cost. 30% tax
is really 50% increase in money that you have to make in order to cancel that out. So,
the two fallacies are unqualified percentages, and discounts are smaller than
increases.

If you want to see a place where they execute the real world discounts are smaller
than increases fallacy of understanding numbers, it's the buy two, get one half off.
When you do the math, you end up with two at a price of 150%, which means you
paid 75% for each, which means you really got a 25% discount by buying twice what
you needed. If you told anyone that "I'll give you a 25% discount if you buy double",
they'd tell you to fuck yourself. But, if you abuse the frame, and use the larger
discount, which is 50 instead of 25, they think that it's 50. They don't know that it's 25
because all you mentioned was 50. Most people can't do math so good in their head.




So the example of getting 50% off of buying two, instead of saying you get 25% off
when you buy twice is the difference between making sales and not. You can feel the
pull when you hear the pitch, and I believe that understanding that people only know
the reference number that you've given them - it's called anchoring - and
understanding that people don't understand discounts very well is a useful way to
avoid getting ripped off and getting 25% off when you thought you were getting
something around 50. If you're in the position of setting prices, well, I guess you found
a new way to get your client's money.

Any time you're reading the news or some articles and you see something going up
some 100% or down some percent, you must always ask, of what, to what, from what,
to what? It's the unqualified percentage. It's also like Betteridge's law regarding
headlines, where they say "Something could mean this," or "Is this really that?" and
the answer to all those questions is usually no. If the thing was actually that, then that
would be the headline, and the only time you use stupid headlines like that is when
you don't have something better to write about.

Understanding small discount , large increase equivalence & unqualified percentage

I invented two terms, one is small discount, large increase equivalence where you get
a 33% discount and it really means you would have paid 50% more had you not got
the 33% off. The reason that exists is because sometimes percentages cause you to
know less than you originally knew. In this instance it's just 33 dollars, you can either
pay it or not pay it. The concept of the 33 dollars being a portion of something else, or
a portion of some other thing doesn't really matter in this example. What matters is
that it is 33 dollars, what doesn't matter so much is what portion that 33 dollars is;
whether you take it off the before number, which is quite large, and then it makes the
33 seem quite small, or the after number which is smaller by exactly 33, and therefore
is a larger percentage of that. I don't think you learn that much data by choosing to
take your 33 and divide it by one or the other. The learning is that it is a common
misconception that is going to happen when you take a flat number and try and make
it a percentage for sometimes reasons that don't make sense. The second invention is
the unqualified percentage. So you doubled your sales, yay! But from what? So you
don't ever take someone's percent figure without the "of what". I call the fallacy the
unqualified percentage, and that's basically because the percentage doesn't mean
anything unless you qualify it with the "of what". Just like when you read a fucking
headline; "This matters" - to whom and why do I care? You got to qualify it.

Xx Meta: I don't think it would make it to the book but; Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle, the dual slit theory of wave versus particle light analysis. Basically people
think that when you measure things at the subatomic level that you can measure
them without changing them. Therefore, they think that the universe is conscious and
therefore that conscious universe is measuring what your consciousness is doing. The
conscious universe notices that your consciousness is trying to measure something,
and whereas it normally would just allow two things to exist at the same time and not
decide to be one place instead of another, as soon as you measure it, a decision gets
made and goes to that single place. It's a misunderstanding; it first is an
anthropomorphism trying to assign intention and group game theory, as to that thing
that has a consciousness and is an individual actor with its own mode of operation.
That shit is not conscious and it does not care what you do and the reason it changes
when you measure it, is because at that level, all measurement involves fucking with
the thing you are measuring. You cannot measure something without fucking with it,
and if you can't stop fucking with it, then you are obviously influencing it. Therefore,
it's not the universe that is influencing its decision, it is you through doing the
measurement, which changes instead of the magical measurement which doesn't
exist, which doesn't change, (xx too complicated, not understand :()

Coursera learning how to learn




Week 1: What is Learning?


Brain Facts:

• Cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron
flows to another neuron across a synapse. Human brain has a million billion
synapses.

• Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps
"update" your brain cells. Literally.

Why do we procrastinate (scientifically):

Problem:

Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be
stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated
with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your
attention to something else more pleasant.

Solution:

The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people
start actually working out what they didn't like, that neuro-discomfort
disappeared.

Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can
become.

Consider using the pomodoro technique.

Learning hard and abstract things:

The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create
and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for
you.

Ex: You should practice a lot with the math vocabulary to understand it and
recall it easier. [Jooe x dx, k!(n—k)!]

Summary of what I learnt:

1. There are two modes of thinking:

2. Focused mode: Concentrating on things that are usually familiar.

3. Diffused mode: A relaxed mode of thinking "your thoughts are free to wander".

4. When you don't desire doing/learning something, go through it and just start.

The discomfort goes away and, in the long term, this will lead to satisfaction.

5. When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back
to it and recall what you learnt.

6. This is very important. Don't cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient
learning. It's like building a wall without letting it dry.

7. Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows

that spaced repetition (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build
and strengthen the synaptic connections.

8. Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day
of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.

9. It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your
brain produce new neurons. Don't lock yourself in your room. Stay active and
spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily.


Week 2: Chunking


Chunks:

Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use
and meaning. They can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time,
they are single easy to access items that can fit into the slot of the working
memory.

Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information
that are easier for the mind to access.

Example: If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need
to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That's because your "formula
chunk" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your
working memory to solve it.

Turn off distractions. You want to use all the four slots of your working
memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are
connected to something else.

You have to solve the problem yourself. Just because you see it, or even
understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it (Illusion of
competence). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it's
easy, then doing it yourself.

It gets easier. When you think that a chapter or a book has too much
information and that there's no way to go through them all; just focus on
whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first
concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier.

This concept is called Transfer; a chunk you have mastered in one area can
often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in
different areas.

Master the major idea and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not
to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help
yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a
"picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at
the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used... before diving into details.

Recall mentally without looking at the material. This is proven more effective
than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down
what was in the material.


Consider recalling when you are in different places to become independent of
the cues from any giving location. This will help you when taking a test in the
class.

Test yourself to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself
into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of
competence.

Don't always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung problem (a German word
for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new
better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you
need to be doing is misleading.You've to unlearn old ideas and approaches as
you are learning new ones.

Mix up the problems (Interleaving) from different chapters. This is helpful to
create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit
more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very
important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and
begin thinking more independently.


Don'ts:

Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling.
Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is easy. It can bring
the illusion of competence; that you've mastered the full material when you
actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more
difficult (deliberate practice). This sets the difference between a good student
and a great student.

A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the
textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It's like randomly
allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where
the solution truly lies.


Week 3: Procrastination and Memory


Procrastination:

The routine, habitual responses your brain falls into when you try to do
something hard or unpleasant. Focusing only on making the present moment
feels better.


• Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It
uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn't waste it on fending off
procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don't need to.

• The long-term effect of Procrastination can be dangerous. Putting your studies off
leads to studying becoming even more painful. Procrastination is a habit that
affects many areas of your life, if you improve in this area, many positive
changes will unfold.

• Procrastination shares features with addiction. At first, it leads you to think that if
you study too early you'll forget the material. Then, when the class is ahead of
you, it leads you to think that you are inadequate or that the subject is too hard.

• You want to avoid cramming which doesn't build solid neural structures, by
putting the same amount into your learning, and spacing it over a long period by
starting earlier.

First time learning something:

• The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would
make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will
be simple.

• At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. Ex: Driving for the
first time.

Habits:

• Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

• Habit is an energy saver. You don't need to focus when performing different
habitual tasks.

• Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.

Habits Parts:

10. The cue: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine).

11. Recognize what launches you in zombie procrastination mode:

12. Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events...

13. Consider shutting your phone/internet for brief periods of time to prevent most
cues.

14. The routine: Routine you do in reaction to the cue.

15. You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues.

16. Actively focus on rewiring your old habits.

17. You need a plan. You need some willpower.

18. The reward: Habits exist because they reward us.

19. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.

20. Ex: If I study for 4 hours today, I'll watch a movie, guilt free, at night.

21. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a
new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.

22. Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes
place that will allow you to create new habits.

23. The belief: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief.

24. Ex: You might feel like you'll never be able to change the habit of studying late.
This is not true. You can actually rewire your brain

25. Joining a student community helps, either online or in real life.

26. Trust your system. You have to feel happy and worry-free when you are resting.


Weekly/Daily list:


Researchers showed that writing your daily list the evening before helps you
accomplish them the next day. If you don't write them down, they will take the
valuable slots of memory.

Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.

Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it's only one
pomodoro.

Take notes about what works and what doesn't.

Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

Focus on Process:

You should realize that it's perfectly normal to start a learning session with a
negative feeling even if you like the subject. It's how you handle those
feelings that matters.

Solution: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers
the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this
task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the
days.

Memory:

Use your visual memory to remember things.

Ex: Link a memorable picture to a formula.

Images help you encapsulate a very hard to remember concept by tapping into
visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.

The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses the easier it will be
for you to recall the concept.

Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won't suck
away the neural patterns related to that memory. Spaced repetition is the key.
Flashcards help. Consider using Anki.

Handwriting helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural
memory structures.

Memory Techniques:

Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.

To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.

Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.
Memory Palace Technique: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house)
and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.
This is not easy. You'll be very slow at first. But with practice, you'll get better.
The more you practice your "memory muscle" the easier you'll remember.


Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential


You should know:

• Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps
new neurons survive.

• Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will
hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is
restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

• You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you
perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.

Metaphors

• Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also
understand different concepts.

• It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you're trying to
understand.

Intelligence:

• Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equate to having a large working
memory (more than just four slots).

• However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new
thoughts won't easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention
could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don't
want it to shift.

• Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those
naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

• Brilliant scientist like Ramon y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles
Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success

was perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their
thoughts.

• Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean
your efforts.

Right hemisphere:

• Helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.

• When you go through a homework or test questions and don't go back to check
your work, you're acting like a person who's refusing to use parts of his brain.

Left hemisphere:

• Interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism and
egocentricity.

• May lead to overconfidence. Ex: believing dismissively that your answers are
corrects.

Best practices:

• Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-
hemispheres interactions.

• Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with.

• Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others.

• Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

• Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can't see.

• Don't fool yourself. Don't blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a
team can bring those projections down.



Test Checklist:

• Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide,
did you go through it?

• Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?

• Did you understand all your homework problems' solutions? If not, did you ask
for explanations?

• Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?

• Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?

• Did you sleep well the night before the test?

Test Taking Technique: Hard Start - Jump to easy: (Try this strategy with
homework problems first)

27. Take a quick look at the test when it's handed to you to get a sense of what it
involves.

28. Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2
minutes. Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then
switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work.

29. Turn next to an easy problem. Solves what you can, then move back to a hard
one. This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on
different thoughts.

Taking Test Tips:

• Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it's
under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all
the difference.

• Shift your thinking from "I am afraid of this test" to "I am excited to do my best".

• If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put
your hand on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm
you down.

• Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the
materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared
well. So relax.

• Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy.

• Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck.

Airplane pilots have a check list, you should have a body check list. Do you have sleep
apnea? Stuff in teeth? Using bad eye to shoot a gun? Breath smell, get hearing checked,
vision weird? Is one arm longer than the other? You don't take off in an airplane without
knowing your equipment is good, so why do so many people not know what the real state of
their body is? Isn't your body the most important vehicle you'll ever own, shouldn't it get
checked out more often than your car or bike?

Guess what weight you need to be to be obese

It's much lower than you think: And if you pass a BMI test.

Mindset

Feel good going to sleep early by thinking of tomorrows great performance

Learn to see the profit on feeling great and well rested tomorrow. Realize that
whatever you're doing that you want to stay up late for right now, and screw up
tomorrow, it just seems important because its urgent and present now, but it's
probably actually much less important that what you'll be doing the next day.

If you're up when other people are, you can work with them

How many things that are happening late at night are actually time limited?
You'll likely find that the most important things that go on in the world are
actually happening during the day. Anything that requires massive cooperation
or media impact, or results in profit occurs mostly in the day time because that's
when most of the other people are up and kicking ass.

Benchmark your sleep

Are you getting enough good sleep really? You might want to try a sound machine for sleep
e.g. Marpac.

Sleep apnea

My father existed as a zombie for many years

"There are estimates that only ~20% of sleep apnea in Americans is diagnosed). I
wonder how many other people out there are still stumbling along on their fourth or
fifth antidepressant when CPAP is what would actually help."

Things in threes

Seems like 3 minutes, 3 days, 3 weeks, air, water, food, you need them in the order
than they're available to consume in a primitive world. If the world was different I bet
we would need these things in a different order.

"Pressure-related stuff really fucks with your brain. You take a diver deep and they'll
feel just fine while under nitrogen narcosis.

My scariest example was when I saw another diver having trouble getting his
buoyancy right and not responding to my signals to add air to his buoyancy
compensator (less air in his BC under pressure and a compressed wetsuit makes the
diver less buoyant).

I decided to write down instructions on my slate and had him read it, and he still
wasn't getting it, and was looking kinda freaked out, so I called the dive. He got better
once we'd ascended and he wasn't high, and we got to the surface just fine a few
minutes later. I started explaining his issues and showed him my slate again.

I had scribbled complete gibberish on the slate - like letters on top of each other and
random squiggles. I knew he was having narc issues and what he needed to do to
control his dive, but had no idea I'd lost the ability to write due to my own narcosis. It
kinda freaked me out."

Looking at weight loss in linear terms

If you're a giant fat fucker, it seems as though you're very far from your goal of being
fit, because if you diet a whole day, you are like .01% closer to your goal, right, or
some small number. The fatter you are and the skinnier you need to be, then the
smaller the percentage toward your goal you actually are. If you look at it in
percentage terms, you're fucking far away from your goal the fatter you are. Just like
rolling and starting friction, and starving out a habit, or like wind to love is like wind to
a candle - a little sparks it and too much extinguishes it, right?

If you look at it instead in like linear terms instead of percentage terms, and you just
say, how much weight can I lose in a day? Well then as a fat fuck, you're actually at an
advantage because you can lose more weight in a day because your body's just
smoking through calories like mad. One way you're very disenchanted, which is
probably a shitty way to view it in that you're farthest possible away from your goal
because you're a monster. The other way is probably a better way to look at it which
is it’s much easier for you to make linear progress because, you actually use so many
calories at rest during the day.

R231

It can be more fun to visualize weight loss or other goals by their distance and not
their time, because you can accelerate how much distance you cover, but you can't
accelerate time. For instance, if you need t

o lose 10 lbs. that's 3500 kilometers Xx on a stationary bike. We've evolved to hoard
physical things that are countable, and thus having a distance goal can feel like
collecting something valuable. Having a time goal is a layer or two removed.

Eat to live, don't live to eat

Not quantity at least. You don't need much quantity to have quality. When you eat
you must see how little you can eat, not how much. You've already tried eating how
much you can get away with, and where has that gotten you?

The power of 450 calories

The difference between a 6-inch sub and a 12-inch sub is 45 lbs. If you have
three extra sodas a day you will be roughly 45 lbs. heavier for the rest of your
life, that's how powerful calories are. Consequently, if you drink 3 sodas less a
day, and we are talking normal cans of soda, not the monstrosities you can find
for sale at 7-11, I think you will find by surveying people that they don’t know
how many calories turns into a pound.

Knowing how many calories you are eating is only useful to you if you know how
those calories are going to affect you. That is only possible if you know how
many calories a day your body actually uses. You also can't have false beliefs
about how many calories exercise is worth. If you exercise on a bike for 20
minutes and burn 300 calories, you can't have a snack to reward yourself.
Almost any snack you reach for is going to have more than 300 calories in it.





Think of all the benefits you get from having less caloric intake. Often times
people don't understand or are blissfully unaware about how crappy some
things in life really are. Your teeth, for example. They don't really heal. If you
break a leg, good chance it's going to heal. If you break a tooth, you're fucked.
It's not going to heal itself. What does this have to do with food?

Just like waves eroding a beach, slowly but surely, so does the chewing of food
and other things like ice and gum also erode your teeth away. Since they never
heal, the more you eat, the more you chew and the sooner you will not have
teeth left. In the good ole days when we didn't have cool tools like tooth
brushes, tooth paste and all of the other fun things that you can find in the
drugstore aisle, your wisdom teeth might have had some use when they come
in to push all the other teeth forward and close the gaps from the teeth you'd
be missing.

Maybe you were missing one because you said the wrong thing to tribal leader's
girlfriend, or maybe you bit into an extra hard animal part for food. Nowadays
we take such good care of our teeth, that we don't really want them shifting
around so much up in the front there, and I think all of us has met a person or
two that appears to have way too many teeth in their mouth all crooked and
crossed over each other.

You spend less on food. You spend less time eating. You spend less time
traveling to eat. That saves you money on gas and the likelihood of accident.
Your chance to live longer increases. You'll be healthier and have a better
immune system. Fit into more common and more stylish clothing. You'll be
faster. Need less sleep. That means more time awake to enjoy all these other
benefits. Most important of all, you will look better in a bathing suit.

Just to overkill on it, you'll also serve as an example to your loved ones, be able
to flee and chase faster, and are likely to be paid more at your work, fit through
tighter spaces, set off the alarm on the elevator less, pay less for health
insurance, need to use the health insurance that you may already have less,
cause the death of less animals or plants or likely both. Use ever so slightly less
gasoline to work, there's a whole lot of upside here. You're also less of a target if
you play dodgeball or paintball.

In a world where we're much more limited by how much we want something
than by our intellectual ability to understand how to get it, it's more important
to have a consuming desire and drive towards something, than it is to optimize
how you get to the goal. A great plan not executed is far worse than an ok plan
executed. At least where matters of life and death and injury are not as large a
concern. That's why the why of something is much more important than the
how, as far as motivation is concerned.

If you only eat foods that have a known caloric value, it will be much easier to
add up how many calories you ate in a day. Some people have good luck with an
app called MyFitnessPal.



For a person that already has strong enough why's and is already dedicating the
hours, for those few, the how is far more important.


How do you make sure that you're hitting the right caloric intake? First know
how much calories you actually use in a day. Using WolframAlpha.com you can
calculate your BMR: Basal metabolic rate. This is the amount of calories you
burn a day with no exercise, or if you choose it, whatever level of exercise you
think matches your day. There are no magic people. These numbers have been
proven over and over again. You eat over your BMR, you gain weight, you eat
under your BMR, you lose weight.

Watching your calorie count beats and crushes every other form of weight loss
trickery. This includes food mixing and matching, protein vs carb vs fat macro
ratios, exercise, food timing, alternate fasting, alkaline diets, stimulants, you
name it. It all gets crushed by just basic calorie count. Which is why there's a
very simple tried and true formula that predicts whether you will lose weight or
not, and it doesn't ask you or want to know whether you are doing any of those
other things at all. If you think the BMR calorie calculator is wrong, please
document how your results differed from what the proven 50 year old math
predicted, so that you and the others like you can improve the math formula.
Like so many other things though, it's usually the case of bad math or bad
measurements, than it is that science needs to update the formula.

Eat less often

If you eat less often, you may have better teeth health. Because, there's less
chance for shit to like keep getting applied on there, right. If you eat all your
food at once, you know, like, it's like coffee right. If you drink your coffee
through a straw it has less time on your teeth and therefore, your teeth are less
likely to get stained. Well it's the same thing with a like eating right, if you eat
less often but larger quantities, well there's less time that the shit gets to stay
on your teeth.

Who's good at dieting

You know who's really good at dieting? Everyone that's not fat. As a matter of fact,
people who are not fat, never got fat enough to have to lose the weight so they may
be the best at dieting of all.

Fat joke

To make fun of someone that is chubby you could say that when they were swimming
you'd hope that a shark doesn't bite them so that the shark doesn't get high
cholesterol.

R662

Dieting beats exercise for weight loss.

Your digestive system never sleeps, but you do.

The rate which you can gain weight is limited by an unconscious autonomic
system that is always working whether you mentally will it to do so or not. Your
digestive system. So on the intake side you've got a constantly working machine



that takes whatever you put in it and turns it into nice fat stores for you, so you
don't starve to death. Nice tummy.

Now on the output side you have basically the same autonomic system of
breathing and staying warm, which if it was balanced well enough with your
intake side, you'd probably have already skipped this chapter, being already fit
and all. So now you have to engage your conscious will power to help generate
heat and movement to get rid of the excess energy stored in your fat. Well, that
is definitely not autonomous, so now you have an autonomous system working
quite easily against your will power. The will power is at a distinct disadvantage.
It is 12 times faster to eat food than to burn it off.

Time to shove a burger in your face, chew and swallow it, oh, a minute or two.
Time to exercise at full tilt to burn off that cheeseburger, 30 minutes. Full tilt
for most people will really take about 45 minutes. If you're on the stationary
bike at the gym and you're going 10 miles an hour, then you're in for 45 minutes
before you burn that cheeseburger.

So in cheeseburger land it takes 45 minutes of brisk biking to cancel out 3
minutes of normal eating. 12 to 1 ratio. This is why cutting energy in is more
effective than trying to out exercise a bad diet. And really, if you briskly put as
much effort into eating that burger as you do biking at lOmph, the ratio would
be 45 to 1, because who couldn't scarf down a cheeseburger in a minute if they
wanted to?

Think of food in cheeseburger units

My favorite unit for dieting, the cheeseburger. Cheeseburgers are about 300
calories each. To lose a lb. of fat you have to cut out or use about 12
cheeseburgers.

Choose to not eat that tasty thing, instead of eating it and trying to burn it off.

It's not as easy to not eat 12 cheeseburgers you otherwise wanted to. On a dare
you can easily eat 12 cheeseburgers in an afternoon. Basically the rate which
you can gain weight is 10 times faster than the rate that you can lose weight.

BMR

Interesting shortcut for rmr (bmr?)xx

Body weight x 10 = Resting metabolic rate (RMR) Plus

From < http://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips/burn-calories-stationarv-bike >

Food as a drug

If you're using food to change the way you feel, then you're always going to tend to have
more calories input than you need. Food already tastes amazing as is, without the added
benefit of being used as a mood altering substance. Those two combined can make weight
loss nearly impossible.

Calorie counts are all wrong

Because they include the calories you would have burnt anyway just sitting there. So you
take your BMR and you add your exercise calories and you think that is how many you used,
but its wrong, because a 240 lb guy burns about 100 calories an hour just sitting there
breathing. So if you work out for 10 hours, and add that to your days burn, you will be off
by 10 hours of 100 calories where you were double counting the rest calories once in the



bmr and once in the calorie counter. This gets even worse the more hours a day you work
out. So if you work out 10 hours you're calorie counts are off by 1000 calories.

Let your surroundings be free of temptation

It's easier to pass over food for a few seconds on a store shelf, than it is to avoid eating too
much of it every day if you bring it home.

Paleo diet fantasy

Bananas are all clones, there used to be another option but it died off.

If you like the idea of a paleo diet, you'll have to just like the idea, because everything that
you would have eaten back then doesn't exist anymore, we improved it all flavor and size-
wise.

Never eat to fullness

You know what, you can make a little change; a little change on the way we eat, and just
stop eating when you're full. Drink water, you're going to lose a lot of weight, it's free, it's
awesome, everything's better, your teeth are better. Therefore, let's do the smarter thing,
the smarter thing is to drink water instead of Coke, the smarter thing is to stop eating when
you're full, the smarter thing is to drink the water before you eat, so you're already more
full, your stomach's stupid, it can't tell whether there's water or food in there, it knows
you're stuffed.

Bathroom and Potty Protips
Potty tips

You can avoid toilet water splash, and have a quieter pooping experience if you drop a piece
of toilet paper in first.

You can pee quietly by peeing on the side of the bowl.

You cannot have a split beam pee all over the bathroom experience if you pre-spread the
opening of your dick. This is a bigger problem the more you cum, for it seems cum likes to
seal the end more than pee.

Poorer countries tend to have less hemorrhoids because they squat more often than they sit
to poop. It's also likely that they consume less food and therefore use their assholes less
often and at lower volumes. Either way, it seems like the animal world has decided that all
peeing will take 30 seconds regardless of your size (xx true, cite source) and that squatting is
a pretty cool way to poop if you're a land based mammal.

Warm up the water while you're finishing your business, so it's ready for blasting your
neither regions in the cleanup/paperwork phase. You don't have a way to rinse your butt?
Well, the Europeans really got this one right, you'll use much less toilet paper, and have a
much cleaner butt if you use water. Water is friend.

Some small amount of toilet paper dust and crap dust makes its way into the air when you
wipe, so it's not vital, but slightly cool to shield your tooth brush, rinsing glass, floss, tongue
scraper, etc. from the crap dust.

Tongue scrapers are awesome. Most of what causes bad breath is the crap that lives on
your tongue. Some folks unfortunately have extra spaces in the backs of their throats where
food gathers and rots, and creates tonsillitis, google that word at your own peril. If you have
these things, you really have to get rid of them manually, or have a professional do it, or
your breath will always smell terrible. If you want a more permanent solution, they can
later off the area to make it so food can't get stuck in there.



Squatty potty

Apparently if you change the position of your legs and you squat while you shit or
maybe you lean over real far on the toilet and it helps with your shitting.

Supplements

Supplements

Check out examine.com and you'll see most supplements don't do much for you. Do you
know how do they decide what the US recommended daily allowance of a vitamin is? They
keep increasing the dose of the vitamin until you're pissing it out and then whenever you
start pissing it out, that's the daily recommended value. Because they assume your body
used it and so it’s not so bad to eat it. That’s the daily allowance.

As far as I'm concerned that seems to be like a silly way to do it. Because things like catalysts
exist. There are things that may not get metabolized. You will piss it out but it's presence in
higher or lower quantities in your body will cause effect.

When you eat supplements, and they're said to be good for you but quite often, they're not.
Because there's something else going on that we don't know about. For instance, eating
fish. We know eating fish is good, and we know eating fish oil isn't as good. We know eating
calcium is good, and calcium pills aren't as good. There's either some other thing in there
that we haven't discovered yet, or, it's a combinations of things that are important. To give
you an idea of how complicated the biological world is, certain compounds have a right and
left turn. They're the same molecule, just different shape. And that shape can kill you. Prion
disease is a misshaped protein in your brain. Its geometry causes other proteins to get
fucked up, just like it is. Therefore combinations and catalysts play a huge role.

Teeth

Do

Use Xylitol and fluoride mints, floss/brush/Waterpik as soon as you can after eating
Chew only as hard as needed, teeth break on bones in meats
Never chew ice.

Floss and brush as soon as you can after every time you eat or drink sugary stuff.

If you knew what it cost to fix your teeth, you'd take even better care of them. They don't
regrow or heal. You have to do everything you can to keep them in good shape. The biggest
problem they have are these little creatures live on them. They eat part of what you eat,
especially sugar.

The problem is that when they crap out what they eat, it melts your teeth. If you can starve
them by eating less sugar, make it harder for them to stick to your teeth with Xylitol gum or
breath mints. Make sure they don't have homes to live in. They make houses on your teeth
called biofilm, or calculus or tartar. Get your teeth cleaned by a professional. Don't leave
food on your teeth for them to eat. You can also shake them up with an ultrasonic tooth
brush, reach hard to reach spots with a Waterpik. Fix your teeth, smile more, or just be cool
with freaking people out.

If you have nicer teeth, you might smile more, and thus be happier

Scientific American says that by consciously smiling, we trigger a psychological feedback
mechanism that causes us to be happy. I had an amazing realization last year-1 wasn't
smiling, and it was because I was unhappy with my teeth. They weren't awful, but they were
crooked enough to make me self-conscious. It's very hard to smile when doing so makes you



self-conscious about your teeth- every single time. By avoiding smiling, I was dampening my
own potential for spontaneous happiness!

Hidden problems
Teeth


Record yourself sleeping, Do you grind your teeth in your sleep?
If so get a mouth guard.


Bad breath

Bad breath

It's a giant, giant problem. If a person's nose works properly, and your breath is stank, they
will be very likely to stay as far away from you as necessary to make the terrible smell stop
assaulting their senses. And sadly, since they know it will likely bother you personally to
hear about your breath smelling, or for some other reason, see profit in not letting you
know about it, you literally won't know about it, because it's something that's very hard for
you to detect personally. So really you need to every once in a while blow in someone else's
face and ask them to check for you, because to my knowledge there's not a mechanical way
to test. Teamwork for the win.


Skin

How do you use this thing called your body?

In the winter if your skin is itchy you should lotion up mother fucker. Who knew that? I was
never taught that shit. I learned that from a comedy special from bill burr when I was 30.
You think there's something wrong because of itchy skin but it's just really dry.

It puts the lotion on the skin

Sunscreen, lotion. Itchy skin in the winter? Lotion just might fix that. Soap is a rather new
human invention, and as much as we use it, we probably need to cancel out the wiping out
of our natural oils with some lotions.

Butt hair

In case you're curious why you have butt hair; lubricant, stops chafing. Notice, you get furry on
those places where there is rubbing, and if you didn't have fur there, you may sustain injury. Two,
if you wonder why people might go bald - vitamin D or wisdom signaling.

R779

Vision & Peripheral vision
Peripheral vision

Peripheral vision appears to be much faster in my measurements, and I think the science
also points towards this. Call it a small sample size, however, my fastest time ever on the
reaction time thing was a 75 ms when I purposely looked away from the screen, so that the
part that would change color was just in my peripheral vision. This seems like a pretty great
idea from an evolutionary advantage perspective, because it's more important for you to
become aware of threats and opportunities that aren't already on your radar, more so than
it is perhaps to deal with what you are already aware of. I wonder why they're mutually
exclusive? Does this same pattern of recognition speed differential exist in other species?
Do those species use it for more offense or defense?

Issues of perception

My left and right eyes see color ever so differently. One of them has a slightly warmer tone
with a little shift to red, and the other eye is slightly cooler with a shift to the blue. Test it
out yourself. Cover one eye, look at a colorful photo or scene. Now put your hand over the
other, go back and forth real fast, do you see a difference in the color tone? If you're lucky



enough to have the same perception in both eyes, you still definitely don't see colors the
same as other people! For instance, we've discovered that some percentage of us,
particularly women, can see a vastly wider array of colors (behavioral biology lessons from
smart Stanford dude: (xx Human Behavioral Biology, Sapolsky, Stanford / From
< https://www. youtube. com/playlist?list=PL45A5E21ECA5FA850 >

What he states is that what spectrum of wavelengths one person is taught to be a color might
differ from someone else’s perception of what wavelengths constitute that color.

i.e. A color between red and yellow somewhere might be seen and remembered as red for
some and orange for others.

This is interesting, especially, when it comes to memory in the way that if Me and a friend
sees a car that I see as something in between of red and orange, but he sees it as red. He
will have a higher chance of remembering what the color of the car was when asked later.

This is also relevant to pattern recognition of language both vocal and written, Jesus' face in
toast, your grandma's face and Jennifer Aniston among other things, and goes hand in hand
with evolutionary theory in the way that recognizing the pattern of a predator in the bushes is
advantageous.

I highly recommend giving the introduction video a try, or reading his zebra book which is
linked to in the description.

"...In June 2012, after 20 years of study of women with four cones (non-functional

Benchmark

Benchmark, how's your vision really?

Eyes

It's pitch black dark out. You've got much more color sensing in the center of your eye, and
much more light detection with the rods, which can't see color on the edges of your eye, it
changes the way your eye responds to peripheral activity. You can respond to threats
coming in your field of vision quicker. It also means that if it's dark out, you could sometimes
see things better. By changing the part of your eye that is seeing them, you might end up
moving your head around or moving your eyes around. Seeing something better, even
though you're looking with the same eyes. Not every part of your eye works the same. Not
even close.


Hearing







Even if your account for Fletcher Munson curves, they probably had wide variance when they
generated it, and you don't know what has happened from injuries or concerts, or car stereo, or
headphones. And if the abuse you've given your ears effects what you can hear. I wonder if
Fletcher Munson curves exist for eyes? Unless everyone in the world is mastering at the same
volume in dB, there's no hope they're hearing even close to the same thing. Would be nice if
movies played a quick test image or two, so you could know if what you were seeing was what
they wanted you to see. This is what they do in the television and broadcast world. The old Indian
and other test patterns.

Posture

People bending over

I see people bending over to look at their laptop, crimped over like chimps looking at the
banana on the ground. Why is it that the man should serve the laptop instead of standing
strong and having good posture and letting the laptop serve you? Move it, don't move
yourself.

Runners

Business idea

Runners should have a weight distribution sensor in their shoes to warn them when
they're doing harm to themselves through imbalance or bad form. You can see some
of this after the fact by looking at how the soles of your shoe have worn, it takes a
while for them to wear though.

Muscles and respecting the inches

It's funny how much one inch of muscle around a human body gets respect. It's
because that one inch is the difference between win and lose in conflict. We wouldn't
give as much thought to one inch more or less on an elephant. That's because it
wouldn't make any difference, there's already so many inches.

It's also funny how hard it is to put that inch there, or cut fat out. That little inch. That
ability for life to lose the smallest amount of weight, say ten percent. That little bit
creates respect. This is a left over artifact of our days before force multipliers, perhaps
collectivism, tribalism.






The amount of work that it takes to put an inch or two of muscle on your bicep or
your neck is hundreds of hours, over months. The amount of respect those couple
inches gets you with reasonable men is also pretty large. It's funny to think that only
millimeters of difference lets you tell the difference between one human's face and
another. An inch here or there on another person's body will cause you to feel fear or
lust so easily.

You see, we care so much about those few inches, because for women, it might mean
having enough calories to handle another life growing inside them. It might also mean
not getting demolished physically if you piss the wrong guy off. We care about those
inches, but these days with jujitsu, mace and firearms, we haven't evolved the ability
to detect and honor those force multipliers. At least not in the same way we have the
obvious physical traits that have been around tens of thousands of years.

The tools and tactics we have developed overtime and spread throughout our
populations makes us vastly more effective in all the things we choose to do. Both
good and evil. A tool is a force multiplier. As is the gear, the wheel and so on.

Where you used to get a little out of what you put in, now you get a lot more. Take for
instance, the firearm. You move your finger quarter of inch over here, and that guy
over there dies.

You press your foot one inch down, now you're going a hundred miles an hour in your
car. You move your foot one inch off the gas, now you're stopped.

Being strong is better than being fast

Running analogy vs facing your problems powerlifting. The weakness of running from
your problems instead of getting stronger and facing your problems.

Quote

"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a
shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his
body is capable."

amateur-in >

Whole body movements are more useful in the real world

Do big compound exercises at high weight and low reps. That way you're getting the
most strength and muscle growth out of the least time. Best bang for buck, if you will.
Some would say you're getting the most strength, period. I prefer to be learning or
doing almost anything else than lifting weights for vanity. Such is the competitive life
we live. But if you want a quality mate, you want to be doing some lifting. How else
can they tell you're better than the rest if the rest look sexier than you?

If you're going to be sitting watching television, or writing a book, or lazily enjoying
the Internet, you mind as well be pedaling your feet while you are doing it. After a
while, it's natural and you feel like doing it. Best part, you can eat more of what you
like, and be more fit, with limited cost.




The downside is that you're going to sweat a bit, so you're going to need to shower a
little more than normal. I built an exercise bike, gaming computer station. You can
buy standup desks, and add-ons that let you attach your laptop to a bicycle.

If you need to move around for fitness anyway, you could try learning a skill while
you're doing it. Fighting, dancing, a sport. The gains you make in fitness can be eaten
away by the passage of time and laziness, the skills gained stay for a lifetime.

If you go to a gym rat that's huge, he might know how to work out well, he might not.
How big he is has nothing to do with what he knows. It has to do with how long he has
been in the gym, and so the people that get the biggest are not the smartest.

R157

People that get the most results in the gym are the ones who have done it the longest

The people that get the most results from the gym they're the people who have done
it fucking longest. You are as fit, as you have been recently working out consistently.

As soon as you stop working out consistently, for a period of time, whatever fitness
you had, is fucking gone. This is why I like weight loss better than fitness, because
when you lose weight, that fucking weight stays lost. When you fucking lift weights
and get stronger, maybe you get a little muscle memory, maybe it comes back a little
quicker.

R158

Steroids

You have to look at drug sales, assuming they're not lying about the numbers. Which,
they probably aren't. Required by law to be truthful and all, if they're a public
company. Who's taking all these steroids? Shit loads of them are getting sold.
Somebody's taking them. Well, I would say that the people that are the most gigantic
are taking them. They could do the same thing for any type of other performance
enhancing substances.

I was reading some studies. Apparently taking steroids adds more performance than
lifting weights, by a factor of like maybe fifty percent more, or double. By taking
steroids you put on more muscle mass than you will by actually lifting weights. If that's
the case then might you save yourself the time, unless you really need to learn the
physical exertive of skills of being able to actually lift heavy shit.

You never intend to lift heavy shit anyway. You're doing it just for looks. Might not the
time savings of some fucking steroids outperform actual weight lifting? And then
you've got the thing that when you're in the store and you see some guy that's
obviously jacked on steroids and just drinking coffee and protein. Do you want to live
that lifestyle and even if you did, how are you going to get there without the steroids?

Let's say that guy on water, chicken and steroids is up against you, on working out.
You're getting crushed by fucking double. You aren't going to ever be able to make it
up. I don't see any other way in today's environment. Since everyone decided to hop
on the fucking illegal drug freight train. Should you not go that route, if that's your
fucking goal? If everyone else decides that they're going to work for free and you
decide you want to keep charging. I don't see how you'll win that battle.



Weight training

I've been thinking about how useful weight training is. There's still things you can't
train. Let's say you want to grab a screw, your hands won't be strong enough, no
matter what. You still need a screwdriver. Still need pliers.

Looking strong

Work on the muscles people see

Fat distribution on your arms can make you look stronger, or on your legs make you go
slower (or arms.) Some fat dudes look stronger than they really are.

Cool mental tips to keep going
If I can't I must
40% rule

"He would say that when your mind is telling you you're done, you're really only 40 percent
done. And he had a motto: If it doesn't suck we don't do it. And that was his way of forcing
us to get uncomfortable to figure out what our baseline was and what our comfort level was
and just turning it upside-down."

Fans are cool
Faster fan

Subconsciously you might not like sweating, more fan=less sweat.

Porn power

Your body has built in mechanisms to amplify performance. Porn can activate you, violence
can activate you, a slap in the face, music, caffeine, etc
Nuke your heart rate to start

Everything after you've warmed up seems easier, and it seems to let you hold a higher heart
rate for longer, which means you burn more calories.

High intensity

Gets your lungs to understand they need to be larger, because if you never reach their
limits, why would they get bigger? It's the equivalent of having a freer flowing air system in
your car's engine, free peak horsepower.

Honor the bad workouts

The less you want to do it, the better. Can't hit the same numbers you're used to hitting?
That's great, you're pushing the limit, so just back off the weight a bit, or a whole lot. Unless
you're injured, you should still try to keep up the habits, even if you have to go in and
pretend to do the lift. Whatever it takes to maintain the habit. The habit is worth 100 times
what the lift is worth. Maintain your good habits!

Workout in the cold

If you want to be warmer, work harder, helps you not have the drops in performance where
you don't notice you're slacking, the cold reminds you that you are slacking.

Music

BPM

If you know how to dance, you know that your moves stop and start at multiples of
the beat, thus if you want to hit a certain speed on a cardio machine, it can help to
have music that hits the same beat naturally that you're trying to hit. If you want to hit
80 rpm on the bike, 160 bpm would sync each extension of your leg with a tick of the
rhythm. If you enjoy dance, and exercise, I would have to imagine that the dance
instinct would modify your exercise behavior by going faster for faster songs within
reason. You can find pre-made playlists to fit different paces and beats per minute.



Germs

Not getting sick

If you're a dangerous disease, you need people to spread you before they die. It goes the
same for the common cold and flu, those germs need you to shake hands and sneeze near
other people before they can tell you're sick, so that they can't avoid you. Thus germs and
diseases have a profit in infecting you and being communicable before they're detectable,
so people can't' avoid them. Thus, don't shake hands with people more than you need to
unless you're ok with the risk of getting sick. There's a fine line between having enough
germs around to have a healthy immune system, and getting sick more than needed.

Everyone's got something wrong with them, Become your own expert

When you have something uncommon and weird happen with your body, and you take the issue
to your doctor, he's going to end up googling it just like you would, because the number of things
that can go wrong with you will always be much larger than the number of things he's had time to
study in his life, regardless of his dedication. We're just so complex that the only hope we have to
fix each other is to specialize. Now what are the chances that the first guy you visit just happens
to be an expert in the field that you need?

Alternative medicine isn't medicine

Do you know what happens to alternative medicine that is shown to work? It just becomes
normal medicine. Just like Aspirin, which is based on Willow tree bark, and has been known to
relieve pain for a few thousand years. Things that don't actually work get to stay "alternative."
Steve Jobs thought he could cure his cancer with fruit instead of surgery. It didn't work. Sadly, it's
easier to trick someone than it is to convince them they've been tricked, so the number of people
that can't be shaken free of silly/stupid/harmful ideas is just too damn large.

Don't screw with the complex system that is your body

What you learn about complex systems is that they're hard to control. The reason they're hard to
control, is because they're complex. When you try and edit a complex system with self-regulating
fucking behaviors - you can't just change the one thing. You have to change the other thing that
helps edit the response to thing that you changed. That cascading waterfall effect of all the
different shit that you didn't know you're supposed to be measuring. Or, you didn't notice
changed leads to fucked up outcomes that you didn't want.

A good argument for the human beings, being the most complicated thing, we're aware of in the
world. Is, by defining complexity as the number of components a thing has. The number of
variables. That is the number of self-modifying things that make understanding much harder.
Because what you understood in the beginning as soon as you attempt to make a change. It
changes itself in response in a way that almost seems, conscious. Like a conscious actor. I am
unaware of any other system more complex.

You're risk from trying to make modifications to that complicated system. It's probably larger than
you know, and probably larger than you'll ever actually be able to know, until we know a whole lot
more about how the body works. And it goes the same way for any complex system.(This should
go to risk management as well). Medicines, in particular. If you can avoid taking medicines that



you don't need, then you also get to avoid discovering how those medicines were actually
misunderstood. When would you be willing to take more risks?


Well, if you're trying to avoid the uncertain negative outcome that you don't know what would
really happen bad, but you don't want to find out either, that's the one thing you're measuring.
Fear of the uncertainty. Accurate fear, proper fear, fear works, that's why it's around still. It's very
effective. Fear is quite good when used properly. If you already know that it a separate terrible
thing is coming for you, and is more certain, well then it's a good trade.

R304

In life your body is a self-correcting, self-regulating basically conscious actor. I'm stretching the use
the word conscious, but it has its own agenda whether it's conscious of it or not, and it wants you
to do things a certain way. When you decide that you're going to fight about an issue. Like Hey!
Body I want you to have less body fat. Hey! Body I want you to feel high. I want you to feel
connected to the world and have trails that you see and you know I want your heart rate to be
really fast and like feel feelings of euphoria ecstasy.

When you want those things from your body, your body doesn't want those things. Your body will
respond to those chemicals that it doesn't want there by locking up the receptor that they're
trying to access it with other things, or by becoming tolerant, not through some type of balancing
behavior of its own, but through just some other mechanism.

Maybe your body doesn't need to fight against what you're doing because some other thing fights
against what you're doing anyway. Take light for example. If you look at bright light, if you look
out your window it's bright out there and then you look back inside your takes time for your eyes
to readjust to that other level of light. Now is that a side effect of your body trying to do a specific
thing? In this case your body is trying to help you have a better view of the world, so your body's
doing its best to help you. But it's the reality that's holding you back. It's the reality of the
mechanical biological framework of how your eyes operate.

They just can't see that much dynamic range of seeing that brightness without having to lock your
iris closed and seeing that darkness without having to open your iris up. Because the photo
receptors we have aren't as amazing as I guess they could be. We have to do this other external
opening and closing thing to make up for their weakness. Even in places where your body's doing
its best to help you get what you want instead of not, you have to account for the fact that a
behavior is going to change over time. The response that you get is going to change over time, and
there should be a minimum effective dose. There should be diminishing returns. And then there
should be an overdoing it. If you're not aware of those three data points then it's going to be very
hard for you to have a relationship with any behavior.

Whether that's gambling or gaming or singing or doing drugs, you need to know the min, the max
the normal. Are you genetically predisposed to have a psychological problem? Maybe L.S.D. is not
for you. Genetically predisposed with like a heart valve to factor arrhythmia, the irregularity of the
way your heart operates, where you take a stimulant and now your body works super long.

Drugs

Drinking alcohol

Account for your diminished capacity.



Only cross streets when it's safer than normal. Take less risk. Do less shit that might
result in injury.

Drinking alcohol is a loan against the future you pay back with interest.

When you drink too much, you usually pay for that fun endeavor with hours of
shittyness the next day, and depending on how many laws you broke, lots of next
days.

The safety position

of being turned on your side when you're passed out drunk or knocked out. If they
throw up they don't choke and die on their own vomit.

Don't let drug companies discover their drugs safety on you.

Medicines, in particular. If you can avoid taking medicines that you don't need, then you
also get to avoid discovering how those medicines were actually misunderstood. So, when
would you be willing to take more risks? Well, if you're trying to avoid the uncertain
negative outcome that you don't know what would really happen bad, but you don't want
to find out either, that's the one thing you're measuring. Fear of the uncertainty. Accurate
fear, proper fear, fear works, that's why it's around still. It's very effective. Fear is quite good
when used properly. If you already know that it a separate terrible thing is coming for you,
and is more certain, well then it's a good trade.

If you know that you're going to have a heart attack because your HDL/LDL profile is so
screwed up, and there's so much cholesterol in your blood that your arteries are just
clogging up quicker than they could be, well then you go oh, you know, I'm fat this is
probably a good idea. Because yeah, maybe it screwed something else up, but that's a good
trade for knowing that it helps this one thing that you know you're going to have a problem
with soon, right? If you have mental illness and your option is guaranteed crazy, or this
other medicine that might make you shake and pee yourself but you're no longer crazy,
shaking and peeing yourself is probably a good deal. Right? Don't take an absolutist view in
regards to taking medicine that works. Do take an absolutist view if you take medicine that
you need and only what you need, and be reasonable with what need means.

Don't drug and drive

How many people know that when they read a medicine label that says? "Do not operate
heavy machinery while using this." How many people do you think know that heavy
machinery actually means a car? Most people don't realize that you're not supposed to
operate a car when you take a medicine that say "don't operate heavy machinery." Now as
far as I'm concerned that's bad user experience design.

Drugs are riskier depending on your family history

Do you have a family history of psychosis? You shouldn't be fucking around with drugs. Do
you have a family history of alcohol addiction? You might be predisposed to alcohol
addiction, maybe you don't fuck around as much with alcohol. Do you have a family
addiction to gambling? Well, let's either assume that hereditary doesn't exist which is
obviously not true because it's very likely that you look like your parents, it's very likely that
you have some similar mannerisms to them, you might like the same foods at the same age
that they might. If you look back at their history, you might find that when they were young
they liked the same foods that you like. Hereditary exists. Learn what fucked your family up
or was likely to, and avoid those pitfalls. It's very easy to look up what contraindications are.
It wouldn't take more than two hours to know what you should be fucking looking out for.


Tonys Drug Chapter



I still think it's useful to compare and contrast repetitive / risky / highly rewarding behaviors,
and the repetitive / risky / highly rewarded behaviors associated with taking drugs, because
some drugs can give you a broad perspective of what actually takes place with any
repetitive, risky, pleasurable behavior in life. A shorter more "in your face" time frame offers
the most vivid perspective as to the risks, upsides and downsides of engaging with certain
activities, behaviors, lifestyles, people, emotions and can provide valuable data that is useful
for recognizing patterns in those arenas.

Pattern recognition is a necessary component of progress, and some drugs offer range
detection as to where certain practices & behaviors might or will lead, not to mention the
potential discoveries associated with inducing abrupt physiological change. One of the
upsides to engaging with drugs can be good practice for mastering relationships & balance
with risky behavior, and high reward stimuli. I for one recognized the dangers of gambling
after I noticed a similar pattern with a previous experience .The goal is to pre-simulate the
extremes in life in regards to what you input and practice so you that you can find a nice
spot somewhere in the middle with the knowledge of how bad and how good certain things
can be. Minimum effective dose is the aim, and diminishing returns is the undesired
outcome, I think it is incredibly useful to cultivate the ideal relationship with the things that
introduce change so quickly.

Now, not all drugs are extremely addictive, some you just enjoy the outcome and not
necessarily the feeling. Drugs come in a lot of different flavors effects, and outcomes, Similar
to behaviors that affect your state. Some drugs can cause psychological dependence, some
lifestyle choices(Ex. Religion) also cause psychological dependence. Some Drugs can cause
physical dependence, and the same can be true with other substances and behaviors in your
life.

Some drugs have an empowering affect that allows the user to distinguish the difference
between external and internal stimulus, illuminating a path to proactive behavior as
opposed to reactive behavior. A radical change in physiology is the fastest way to change
your state, and rapid state change allows you to identify self-limitations, or fears, or pain
points so you can modify the meaning and belief to reinforce better ones. In summary its
useful to know where certain behaviors might lead you without actually engaging in a
lifetime of them, and drugs are one of the viable tools for this. If it is true that there are
substance that can show you what would normally take years of repetition and focus in one
evening, the upside is tremendous, but of Corse everything comes at a price. Drugs are not
the safest tools, however I would argue that the statistics are misrepresenting of the actual
substance danger, but rather the lack of knowledge on usage etc. And recklessness from its
users (which applies to every tool wielded by a fool). I would assume that everyone with a
driver's license is aware of the possible dangers of the act of driving alone, but do not
discard the utility value. It is my hope to see a similar attitude with drugs and their
potential.

Cancer

That which lets you live, also kills you

The data in your DNA, that starts in a single cell, and divides and divides, until here you are,
billions of cells, that data, every once in a while, it also lets something else live in you, that
isn't you, and that life kills you, and itself, at the same time. That's what cancer usually is.



One of your cells ended up with a bad blueprint from perhaps some bad luck while copying,
or a virus, or some radiation, you name it, there's all kinds of ways to get a bad blueprint.

Now usually when that blueprint goes wrong, your immune system notices, and gets rid of
the whole cell with the problem, and you never notice it even happened, but sometimes,
your white blood cells can't tell that this cell is no longer following the blue print that is you,
and instead has its own ideas. It wants to copy and grow when it shouldn't. Now you're in a
fight for your life. Against other life, which used to be on your team, but now it's on its own
team, and if it wins, you both lose. An odd thing life is sometimes. They call this life in you,
that’s no longer following orders, cancer. The quest for life is what kills you when something
else.

Don't encourage cancer by harming yourself
Smoking

Well the answer is that we do the same thing about it that we do with all the other
problems we have in life. We solve them, bit by bit. So with cancer, one of the first
and easiest things to do, is to stop making your cells lives harder than they need to be.
This way they don't' need to be so active, and then you end up with less copy errors,
because they didn't have to copy as often. For instance, when you smoke cigarettes,
you're literally dumping crap that doesn't belong in one of your most vital organs,
smoke, tar, all kinds of things that aren't the oxygen you need to survive.

Your lungs do the best they can to clean up the mess, and try as they might, they still
can't win the battle over time. You may have seen the lungs of a person who's died
and used to be a smoker, no matter how far back in the past they might have quit
smoking, the scars and visible signs off their previous bad habit are remain. So not
only do you have reduced lung capacity, less fitness, the whole time you're alive, you
also have to pay the price for making all those extra cells do all that cleaning, because
those cells had to do so much extra work they otherwise wouldn't have done, now
you are much, much more likely to get cancer. How much more likely? 15-30 times.

More at: http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic info/risk factors.htm
Drinking

So if inhaling crap that's bad for you like smoke and tar, and asbestos, and
nanoparticles, and paint, and fiberglass, etc. is bad for your lungs, because they have
to go in there and clear all that shit out, if they're even able to, well then your liver has
a long list of shit that it has to clear out as well. Your liver's job is basically to keep
your blood clear of bullshit, and what your liver thinks is bullshit is often times what
people wish it didn't.

For example, when you drink alcohol, and you want to feel a buzz, you have to first,
drink enough to overcome your liver's ability to keep it out of your blood, and drink
enough to overcome the blood brain barrier which tries to keep useless stuff that
doesn't belong in your brain out of your brain. So your liver is doing its job, it's trying
to make sure everything works great, and you dong die to some stupid thing you
might have ate. It takes the hit for the rest of your body and sacrifices some of itself so
that every other part of your body can keep kicking ass.



So what do we do? Because we all to some degree desire changes of state, and we've
found a shortcut to state change by getting the drugs from outside and putting them
in, instead of relying no joy and excitement and adventure and fear to generate those
drugs internally for ourselves, as our bodies are great at doing! So the emotional
systems and internal drug system (endocrine system) make better versions of much of
the drugs we try to get outside and put in. Well, the good reasons those systems and
the behaviors that cause them to execute their rewards when they do, they get fucked
over and can't' do their jobs properly anymore, because why go out into the real
world and explore when you can trick yourself into thinking you are, and take a pill, or
a journey into a book, etc. You don't have to do things in the real world to get what
you used to have to back when these systems evolved a really, really long time ago.
You can take the shortcut.

Well because we're lucky enough to still have shitty shortcuts, our livers recognize
them as shit, and try get rid of them! You might want to get a buzz, and slow.

Radiation

Being out in the sun, X-rays, plane flights, breathing radon gas, working near things
you shouldn't be breathing.

Evolution

Does gravity give us saggier boobs and bigger dicks?

This is some definite theory crafting. So they theorize, at least some people have, that
human females have grown bigger boobs just as a signaling strategy. Maybe, or maybe
physics and gravity matters. And if you have to feed the kids, if you don't have to hold them
as high on your body, if you drop them, they don't drop from the same height.

Wouldn't it kind of make sense that if you went from being a non-erect animal to an
upstanding erect animal, that some of the things the geometry worked out for due to their
proximity to the earth, and not having as much travel distance? Maybe, would try and
naturally elongate and find their way back down to the earth. Now a funny part of the joke
would be, maybe our dicks are getting bigger and maybe your tits are getting saggier.

Like I said, theory crafting, I haven't put much thought into it. But it was interesting enough,
the discovery that if you go from a crouched animal to an upright animal, some of your parts
may have worked better down closer to the ground, and so they might end up returning
there over time. R842
Internal biological competition

I wouldn't be surprised if people's eyes were actually developing divergent color and
perception properties so they could combine into a more rounded whole. Perhaps this is
why we appear to have handedness, and use left eyebrow for emotion. As there is
cooperation in the world by dividing roles, so may there be in the human body. We know
your gut bacteria is always at battle, anytime there's life and a limited food supply you're
going to see competition for it. That's not to say that your vision is life requiring food, but
your ability to see threat and avoid becoming food yourself is how such a division of labor
between left and right could have evolved way back when

It's funny how many things are the result of being selected for. Dogs have ears that stick up
and can be aimed so they can not only hear better, but choose where they hear better. As
humans we don't have the ability to point our ears, separate from our head position, nor



can we hear the same range of sounds that dogs do, nor do we have anywhere near as
powerful a sense of smell, we do have tons better vision and vocalization though. Therefore
we're able to operate more cunningly in groups.

Because heredity exists, and because we can control which dogs get to have sex with other
dogs, we've been able to breed dogs over time to have the traits we choose, as we have
with nearly all the vegetables and fruits you eat today, many of these things literally didn't
exist in forms you would recognize 1000 years ago.

It's not just happening with living things, it's happening with nonliving ideas as well. Since
the advent of writing we've been able to keep a reliable record of knowledge through
generations of humans being born and dying, over and over, the people come and go but
the ideas keep on going. There's some pretty tragic loses of ideas which haven't been
written, or haven't been digitized and spread far enough. One such event was the library of
Alexandria where countless treasures of the past were permanently lost. Now we're smart
enough to have geographic redundancy and keep the copies on different mediums so that
even if there's a giant electromagnetic pulse from nuclear war, or giant solar flares that wipe
out much of the electronics we have today, we'll still have copies that are optical instead of
magnetic, etc.

BAADER-MEINHOF PHENOMENON

"De-signing" your life

Get rid of all the reminders and destractions
Be your own faithful servant

Stack the odds in your favor.

Find every edge and use every trick to make the path of least resistance the one that
brings long term fulfillment. Make decisions now that your future self will be likely to
follow. It's a cascade. The better you stack the deck now, the better hand you future
self will get to play.

Overconfidence is way better than under confidence for normally powered individuals.
Daniel Kahneman's advice is dangerous

I see an article on NY MAG regarding Daniel Kahneman's thinking fast and slow. He
says that the most likely emotion to cause you make an incorrect decision is
overconfidence. I think it's the dumbest god damn advice I've ever seen, because
overconfidence is what allows people to do things outside the social norms, and reap
the rewards of having no competition in a market. Or, being the first to do something
or making a breakthrough. Your chances of being overconfident or under educated
are the least today that they have ever been because of the advent of 500 people on
Face book telling you what a retard you are, and how good Google information is. If
you were ever going to be "overconfident", this is the time to fucking do it. Obviously
the more risk weighs upon your decisions, if you're a government or otherwise have
the energy of many people at your disposal, you should be more cautious.

Over confidence is hard to measure

Further regards to Kahneman's thing is that he is giving you not actionable advice. You
can't tell whether you are overconfident or not, so you can't take his advice to not be
overconfident. You basically can be full of doubt and with today's progress you could
do a thing four times wrong and have enough to do the fifth, right while the other guy
is still fucking doubting. Doubting doesn't produce shit.

Evolution

You pinky toe is one easy way to see that you are evolved, not designed.

Aging directors and story tellers mellowing with age (xx change for less arguments)

Testosterone is a great deal when you've got much to gain and little to lose. Yet the longer
you've been around - you end up with more to lose and less to gain. The same effective
reduction in risk taking that is wise in a weakening body is wise economically as well. It
seems to make for shittier stories, though.

Look at great musicians or great film makers. You will notice that as their testosterone dies
down, the type of films they want to make get gayer. They become bigger pussies, instead
of rage or conquest driven competitive type of people.

Write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.

Or do things worth the writing."

Sell not virtue to purchase wealth, nor Liberty to purchase power."

Poor Richard, 1738. An Almanack For the Year of Christ 1738,

Do what wasn't inevitable.

What you should do is your potential impact, times the number of people it will
impact, but there's another thing to look at, which is, would someone else have
achieved that instead of you anyway. Thus there is value in doing the thing that
wasn't going to happen anyway.

If you're writing your thesis,

for the love of God, please do not do what is interesting! Instead do what is
interesting and useful, because it's easy to do. Interest is very easy to peak and
therefore what interests you should also be helpful to the world. The good news is, if
it's helpful to the world, you can actually make money on it.

I want you to imagine a sick kid. The kids dying in his deathbed because he's got some
cancer, and you try and save him and you hand him an app, you hand him an Uber,
and you hand him an iPad and you keep looking at him and he keeps whining in pain,
and you say "what the fuck, why aren't these things working?". Well, because they're
not supposed to. Apps don't cure people.

If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in order to create some positive
benefit to the world, you need to know how to do the thing and then actually do the
thing. Well then, which of these two is the weaker link? Is the world more lacking in
the ability to do things or is it more lacking in the desire to do things? I will tell you
that what the world is missing is desire. Otherwise, everyone would have a six pack,
be fit and would spend time with their families and do all of the things that they know
they should do. They don’t have a lack of knowledge on how, they have a lack of
desire to do so.

If you want to play with the big boys and want to have the biggest impact world and
be able to brag that you work on the hardest stuff that exists in the known universe, I
think the human being is the answer.




Do one thing exceedingly well

"You shouldn't fear the man that knows a thousand different techniques, you should
fear the man that knows one technique very well" - well, why would the education
system be any different? Shouldn't you just learn to do one thing really well and then
move on to the next thing?

A much higher, better use of your intellectual abilities, business talents, talents of any
form are to not solve what other people think are problems, but to solve what you
think are problems. This is assuming that you're smarter than they are and have
better beliefs.

People wonder whether sometimes it's better to go into physics or biology. Well,
you're made of meat and you could say you're made of physics, but let's take a look at
that. Our understanding in application of physics has taken cash and very well
educated people and executed it over a couple of hundred years. That's part of
particle physics, but before they knew particles really existed, you can call it maybe
1,000 or 2,000 years with the Greek discovery of the Theory of Parts, where
everything is actually made of smaller things, great! That was the first instance of this
atomization of the world.

Now, let's take a look at the biological world. How much energy has the biological
world put into figuring shit out? Billions of years with the energy of the sun behind it.

It literally invented sex. It invented DNA. It invented mutation. Holy Shit! This is good
stuff. Now, they've been at it for billions of years, they've had more time to do it. They
didn't require experts to do it, every retarded thing got to participate in the process
and they didn't require cash to do it.

You have to compare, what do you think is going to create more progress in the
world? Learning from the organisms that have had billions of years and the power of
the sun where every retard got to participate or a couple hundred guys with lots of
money over the last couple hundred years? Learning from biology is going to beat the
shit out of trying recreate biology in a lab.

In things that aren't subjective, there isn't a natural human preprogrammed
emotional response limit to the progress that can be made. How fast can computers
get? Well, pretty close to the speed of light as you move on up. There's a bunch of
computer science theory guys that I'm sure will argue with that and I think everyone
would agree that it's a lot easier to build faster computers than it is to make better
tasting food because of the human limiting factor. Might you be able to take
advantage of this? Yes. If you have studied for a year in being good at something that
is touchy, feely, subjective, limited, like art, you may never become great in that area.
The world may not need you to become great in that area and the chance that you
waste a huge chunk of your life doing something no one is willing to pay for and not
even becoming good at it is a shitload higher than if you did something that the world
is willing to pay for and is easier to get good at and isn't limited by subjective
experience.



Now, what might those things be? I don't know. Can you build a house? People like
living in houses. I like living in houses. I don't like getting rained on, snowed on, hit by
fucking lightening. I think houses are great. Now, how smart do you got to be to build
a house? Not fucking too smart. We put a foundation down, concrete sounds good.

We stack some bricks up on the outside, those are walls, that looks good. Does it need
to be pretty on the inside? Sure. Do you like electricity? Sure. You run some pipe, you
run some wire, you cover it with dry wall, you mud the dry wall, you sand and you
paint it. These are things that children could do in playgrounds building sandcastles.
You just have more expensive sand. Literally, that's what concrete is. It's expensive
sand that's glued together.

I would rather see you put your time into something that's guaranteed to pay off and
be amazing for you and get that base framework in where you're useful, you're
effective and you bought your own free time to now choose what you're going to do
with the rest of your life. Then, try and put the artful thing first that's unlikely to pay
off and put you in a world of servitude where you must always spend all of your time
helping other people achieve their dream so that you can get the money to try and
fund yours. What's the summary of all this? You need to know the difference between
what can be taught and what can't be taught, between what is more instinctual and
harder to teach. Why? Because in this free world if you were lucky enough to choose
what you what to spend your time on, what you get good at, you're going to reap a lot
of profit. By getting good at that at which you are pre-inclined to get good at, or is of
highest and best use to the world and teachable more so than you are perhaps
becoming an artist, competing against the machines, competing against all of the past,
competing against tools that aren't improving, paint and paint brushes has not
improved, canvas has not improved, what are you going to do? How is technology and
the progress of time helping you achieve your goals? You just chose the hardest path
that pays the least, that's the hardest to teach. How long do you bash your head
against that wall before you realize you should have built a base, been useful, been
productive for the world and yourself and then fucked around however you wanted?

Common habits of focus, common useful questions. Can I do this 10 times faster,
larger, who can help me with this, who already has had this problem, what other
people work in fields close to this problem, how can this help the most people, is this
the best thing I can be focused on?

The more things you're good at, the more lost potential you have.

Let's say that you're really good at more than one thing. You do one of those things
well. You're not doing other ones. Thus, the ratio of things that you're good at, the
more things you're good at, increases the ratio of things you're not doing. Let's
assume you can only do one thing at a time. You're good at ten things. Now nine
things that you're good at, you're not doing, because you're doing the one thing. Now
let's say that you're good at a hundred things. Now there's 99 things are good at
you're not doing. Holy shit, look at all the unhappiness you can have then.

If you focus being great on a single thing, then when you do that thing, you're not
missing out on your potential in all the other things you could have been good at.

Do what you're cut out for, measure your cut.



Like, you want to see whether you have perfect pitch - which is the ability to hear a
note that is played musically and know exactly what that note is with perfect accuracy
- it's insanely rare and uncommon. If you have that ability then you could and very
likely will have a much better chance of being able to perform, produce, create or
analyze all different types of music. Just the same way that if you look at the
percentage of people over 7"6' that play basketball, it's something like 60 or 70% of
them. Xx Check fact of basketball players height. Some giant portion of those people
play in the NBA. If you've got perfect pitch, definitely look at music. If you've got a
fourth cone in your eye, definitely look at art and things with color, like colorful art.
Same way, if you're 7"6’, give basketball a try. These are some of the few instances
where obvious, measurable genetic differences - and I'm not sure about the genetic
difference on the perfect pitch - but these are things you can test. You can measure
yourself. You can go on audiocheck.net and take the perfect pitch test. It's nice to be
able to benchmark yourself. You can go on humanbenchmark.com and check your
ration, time, ability, memorize shit, all kinds of cool stuff.

Work on the important things first

Executing the Pareto principle in your personal endeavors so that you address your weak
points. I like to call it Pareto efficiency better.

Wish for more wishes

Somewhere along the way adults lose the smarts that kids come up with. They just assume
that shit whatever you want isn't really on the table, so they aim for the floor. If you could
dream the biggest dream, and whatever you wanted would become instantly reality, what
would you dream for? Now harness the power of jealousy, many normal ass humans with
way less resources than you currently have, have achieve likely more than what you're
asking for. So they can't both be true. What you want can't be impossible at the same time
that others are already living that reality. Thus which belief is more powerful for you to
hold? The one that gives you the chance at greatness, or the one that has you failing by
default, and not learning what the real challenges are. The virtual challenges are enough to
keep you weak ass down. Go out there in the world and discover what the real challenges
are.

Needs

Tony Robbins 6 human needs of are a bad way to organize human motivations, (certainty,
connection, significance, variety, contribution, growth?) Nah that's stupid, where is greed on
there? Where is fear? Stupid system for organizing life.

Emotions

Every emotion has a reason for its existence

All these simple belief systems leave out obviously in the game emotions, like greed,
or rage, or envy, they just choose a couple, and say those are the ones that matter,
like safety. The map isn't the territory, and these models of human emotion are
rather simple.

Caring is a resource

You have to choose what you DGAF about, "don't give a fuck" Just as you have to
choose what you buy and don't buy with your money, you have to choose which
things you'll use your limited caring currency on.

Be the master of your emotions

Comedians and musicians make their living causing people good feelings. You too can
make yourself feel good in the same ways. When you're living in tune with your
expectations, you'll find a lasting inner glow and smile that just doesn't seem to go



away. When it first appears, you'll be curious as to why it is that you're happy for no
reason. This is the hidden and lasting joy that comes with living up to one's
expectations.

Adversarial internal logic

When one wants to quit the behavior, but on the other side wants to engage in the
behavior

It's normal. Adversarial internal logic is a breathrouh in machine learning
it's an effective system, works in courts as well

feel worse. I've had it happen where just thinking, how amazing is it that I can feel so
bad right now from things only in my head, and instantly the feeling went away.

Being a nerd

You know you're a nerd when you tell the seasons are changing because the ads you
see on the internet start including bicycles and outdoor stuff.

Values

Needing to feel significant is the power you give the world over yourself.

Consider the future, don't fall for the local maximum
Socrates death

You've optimized for a local maximum of good without regard to the distant
future. Had Socrates remained alive and discovered/shared more, the fast
future of mankind would have benefited far more than whatever the local
people of his time may have. Thus for the majority of humans that will ever
exist, it was surely not "good."

Beliefs

Choosing your destiny

Include quality in your value delta times market share

Elon musk has said that the best way to choose what direction you take with a
business or a career is that you estimate how much better what you think you
can achieve is over what people are currently doing, and multiply that by how
many people you will affect. So you can do a lot for a few people or a little for a





few people. It's an ok way to look at things, sadly it relies entirely on what
people will pay for, and as we've seen forever, fools and their money are easily
parted, so people will pay dearly for all the wrong things, so qualitatively it's not
the best way to look at what you should be doing. Who gives a shit what most
idiots want. Fuck that, lets want something better.

Finding giant deltas

(delta means difference in fancy math speak)

Racism

Families, nations are racist too, so are restaurants, all restaurants would suck if they
had to sell one of everything right?

White privilege is a retarded concept.

1. Let's take top math SAT test scores 2017. Asian>White>Latino>Black. With
the Asians outscoring everyone else combined. Thus Asian privilege right? using
your ["xyz poorly defined phenotype of human" privilege] model. So what
you're really trying to describe is "non black" privilege, which is pretty racist. I
could do this for billion dollar companies (mostly immigrants, hell Elon musk is
an African immigrant.) Tons of races would measure out to have privilege using
your model. It's a bad model using bad terminology, and is racist. 2. Grouping
everyone who's skin color is black into one socioeconomic block is idiotic:

Maybe you're black and born in the UK, or South Africa, or Nigeria, or whitey
whitesville USA. It's the most racist way to group people. If you believe that
where you grew up is more important than your color of your skin, than why
would you group by the thing that you say matters less, the color of your skin?
Because you're too lazy to learn the individual facts of the case, and see beyond
the skin. Stop calling people by white/black group when it's the least descriptive
means to isolate them from a whole. If you think nurture is what matters, then
describe where they were nurtured, and even this is rather insulting. Racial
discrimination and bigotry exist more than white privilege exists. It's a poor and
racist term that insults "black" and "white" people at the same time. Stop being
racist while trying to combat racism.

Mankind's place in the universe
What is life?

Space / aliens

Fermi's paradox

Where are all the aliens? The important question is, whether that
terrible event preventing aliens who've had billions of years to dick
around and be seen doing it, has already occurred, and we passed
it, or has yet to occur, and we're fucked. It's basically a clue that
some shit is likely to be coming our way, extinction level shit, or at
least disassociate with physical space shit. Because we're bounded
by the speed of light, appeals to there being infinite stars aren't
useful. Those huge numbers of stars are too far away to matter,
they mind as well be different universes, or the past.

Far away shit doesn't matter and we aren't first

The reasons we're not likely to be first to be conscious and alive in
the universe, is because there's only a single "first" slot and nearly
infinite "not first" slots. Thus we're nearly infinitely not likely to be



first. First or not doesn't matter, because everyone else is to far
away to ever meet. Damn you speed of light limit.

Turning inward isn't as likely as turning outward Choosing to turning
inward instead of travelling the stars is not likely, for turning inward still
has an energy cost, and energy is finite per unit of space, thus you must
choose between starving other life of energy (think tress competing for
height) or you can expand. Expanding has too much profit to be ignored
by that which evolved to meet the question.

Genders

Social justice

Let's just get some diversity in all the other countries too, lets just open up all
the borders, force every country to reflect the makeup of the world, and watch
it all fall apart and split up again. Worried about no diversity where you live?
Great, go destroy all diversity by equally mixing everyone everywhere.

Tactics to beat social justice warriors.

Appeal to fairness, ignorance of difference is insulting and demeaning.

Get agreement that calling everyone the same is bad.

Point to a set that has two parts that would be insulted if you call
them the same, perhaps Jamaican and African, or Chinese and
Japanese.

Get agreement that calling two different peoples the same thing is
insulting.

Replace those parts with Male and Female gender instead of
nationality.

Hope they get the analogy that calling men and women the same is
as insulting as it was to call the other two parts the same.

You could also use skin color or language or age, or height as the
blurred lens you're looking at people through. Whatever you think
the listener will have the easiest time noticing that ignoring
differences is wrong.

Result of realizing trying to destroy differences is harmful, and
where it should be done, the benefit should outweigh the cost.

It would be insulting to say that everyone from Africa was the
same. As it would be to say that all black people were the
same. As it would be to say men and women are all the same.
The ignorance of difference is insulting. Destroying
differences is worse than insulting and thus perhaps your
quota on how many people of a certain type should be in your
job or profession is also insulting. Perhaps their choice as to
where they want to exist and what they want to do is superior
to yours. Stop insulting and doing other larger harms to
people by assuming you know better for them what
profession or lifestyle they should be leading. You wouldn't
do it with their music, or with their choice of beverage, so
how dare you do it in regards to their work or education?
Difference between men and women



If you think men and women are the same, you either don't know much about
me, or woman, or both.

Women get cancer less than men: http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/03/why-

Pay gap

If women have a pay gap, getting fair pay for jobs that pay less, then men have a
hours gap, doing more work than women. The inverse could show the stupidity
of it, trading women pay gap for male hours gap
Priorities

What are you actually making profit off doing, what's really worth it, to
help you see, what would you be willing to pay to do everything you do,
no more free things, not even your job.

It's unfair to call things wage gaps, as it makes a presupposition that things are
supposed to be equal, and we have a natural tendancy to dislike gaps.

Goals

Maybe you should write a book

If you're smart enough to educate yourself and have the correct opinion about a
subject, then why let that benefit die in your mind, you mind as well help others
benefit from the work you've put in. It's similar to the idea that if you're smart
enough to buy the right product at a good price, then you're also smart enough to
advertise and let others benefit from that good decision you made. They're two sides
of the same coin. If you're smart enough to know what to buy, from whom, and why,
then you're smart enough to transmit that same information on to the next person so
he can make the same informed decision.

If you need to be well educated on a thing to have that good thing in your life, then
you can if you choose, let others benefit from that knowledge

God

Intelligent design

Why is you heart not right in the middle? Why does your stomach work better when
you sleep laying one direction instead of another.

Creationism

Inbreeding might be a feature not a bug

is problematic, and often illegal. Wouldn't it have been easier to make having
children with your own children impossible, as its impossible to have kids with a
horse. Seems like the system for making kids, isn't well optimized, perhaps it's a
bug not a feature though, if you can't find any other mate at all, maybe
inbreeding beats extinction as far as survival goes.

Being good while bad

Fudging the crime stats. Make up. Corsetts. Lying. These all make you look good, while you
remain bad, if not worse.

The failure of philosophy

If you've read any of the great books of history, you already stand in honor of them. If only
the great thinkers of yore had the learnings and tools that we now have. If you insert into
their teachings the things we now know, that they knew not, a new great work would result.

What do we have that they did not? Computation, Evolution, Game theory, hundreds of
years working on the things they left for us to build on. This great wealth of knowledge not




only add, but subtracts from some of the silly ideas the greats had. Silly things like
shopenhauers believe that life is pain. What an easy to disprove assumption One need only
visit a sunny park with ones eyes open. Contentment or even bordeom is a much more
common state than pain. For those uninjurred, pain is a much rarer state than most others.

Smashing hundreds of years of discoveries into the great teachings of old destroys the thin
veneers of inaccuracy and leaves polished the enduring stone.

Only through the application of this hardfought knowledge we've worked so hard for over
hundreds of years can we see the ancient, lasting knowledge for the gift that it was, free of
the clutter of dated ideas.

The meaning of the universe, our reality
Don't cry over spilled milk

Or milk that will have spoiled by the time you figure out if it spilled or not.

Only what is local and soon matters. If the universe is one of many, or a
simulation, it truly matters not. Those problems or opportunities are the
purview of those who are able to pass the hurdle of survival. Biological
problems are coming to kill you and all that you love, they must be solved first.
Mind and body are the same

Most people think their mind and body are separate, until you remove little parts of the
brain in their body, then you discover that the mind stops existing as you take bites out of
the brain. That being said, you'll spend more time in your head than anywhere else in the
world, so you mind as well be great at it:)

Benefit the many, they will benefit you backk

I want you to feel good about doing things for the many, so they can do things for you. You
will get more out of helping others than you can get out of helping yourself.

Xx Meta: This says doing shit once is weak, and doing shit for the many is strong, which is a
statement about scaling, which could easily go under power, however, it's only useful if you
choose to not schedule personal dev, and really its supposed to change your general belief
and value in regards to helping the many over helping the few, of which the single you, is
definitely few. The problem with personal development is that there's only one you. You
can't multiply your benefit times a whole bunch of people. The point here is that, in a world
where you can scale, you will always get more by helping others, than by helping yourself. If
you live in a house, and you didn't build it by hand, or speak a language that you didn't
invent, clearly your life is massively influenced by many many people, who you have likely
never met. If you can help the masses, they will help you back, in ways you couldn't dream.
Focus on the many, and you, you are not the many.

Nightmares are awesome

What better thing could your brain be doing than preprocessing good actions for you to
take if the worst things happen? Would you rather your brain instead prepare for doing all
the right things when everything is going great? When everything is great you probably
don't have to worry that much.

You become what you focus on

What you focus on early in life will color everything else you do after

Elon Musk read space books, loved space, now he does space. Anthony Robbins had
somebody who came by to feed his family, now he has a feeding people charity. If



some shit affects you early in life, it is very likely to affect you later on in life. That stuff
matters. It just matters a little bit less to me. Bill Gates has almost got polio wiped out.
We don't have to wait 20 years for that shit. It could happen in the next five years,
right? I care most about the things that are exponentially powerful now and happen
now, and then we can revisit these other things later.

Fucked if you do, fucked if you don't

Anytime you have a gift and you're not using it, you feel regret even if you know that
gift isn't what you should be doing.

I'm a very social person, I love talking to people. I'm exceedingly good at it.
Unfortunately, I can measure the output and benefit that I've had in the real world
from the connections and social interactions I've had with people, and they're not that
profitable. The things I've done at scale, that affect thousands of people shit on the
one-on-one conversations that I've had.

I guess the only people that wouldn't agree with that measurement are people, that
have never had the privilege of doing things at scale. Whether they be speaking in
front of an audience, having a business, writing a book or having a blog or vlog or
whatever, you choose. What's here the damned if you do, damned if you don't, I'm
going to come up with a better phrase for it, because that phrase sucks.

Here's the problem. Anytime you have a gift and you're not using it, you feel regret
even if you know that gift isn't what you should be doing. How do you win that one?

Game theory

To punish the bad behavior of those that have wronged you, you will naturally feel like being
angry, or hurt, or retaliatory, all of which instantly harm the quality of your life. Meanwhile,
the person that harmed you gets to act even nicer, in apology, or may be oblivious to the
fact that you're even transmitting angry looks and words in his direction. He may be too far
away. You lose, and he doesn't, all because earlier he gained from your expense.

Dream Books/ Dream Boards

I think the best way to understand the value of a dream book, or whatever fancy word for
reminding yourself through environment, of a different pattern of focus than you may
otherwise engage in, is does it influence your behavior? If it influences your behavior and
you chose the image, chose the meaning, and you chose accurately, then it's useful. If it
doesn't influence your behavior, or even worse, if it influences your behavior in a direction
that was counterintuitive to your selection of the image, or whatever it is, that you're
looking at, or influencing yourself through environment with, then you're farther away from
where you started.

I'm going to tell you how I feel about vision boards and dream boards and why in general I
don't like them, but how there's this specific exclusion to how I would like them. If you paste
up sheet music on your refrigerator and sheet music on your bedroom wall, it's a world
different than putting up sheet music in front of an instrument that you actually play. If you
cover your house in recipe books, it's a world different than if you have a recipe book when
you're actually making some food. I feel that vision boards, dream boards, menus and
diagrams and all of those things are infinitely more useful when they're directing your focus,
when you're working in the space. I think that they're less useful when they're just there
and they're not really causing though that's sustained.

Introduction

These are the parts of your brain that usually influence you before you influence them. It's like a
good friend telling you a joke. They're going to make you laugh, because you respond to their
input.

Spirit is "the non-physical part of a person which is the seat of emotions and character; the soul"
and "the prevailing or typical quality, mood, or attitude of a person, group, or period of time." Xx
Source? Add.

If you feel loved or connected to the universe, or a part of something larger and more important,
or religious, those underlying feelings affect how you feel and perform, and whom and what you
spend your time with. It's important stuff.

Emotions

Basic emotions

Average emotional quality of life

Ride the victories. Get a peak and hold it without resampling the happiness. Increase happy
time with little amperage.

Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what
you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.

Epicurus

Greek philosopher (341 BC - 270 BC)

Being happy and complacent gets outperformed and selected against. Happiness is
overrated.

Xx A chapter on "happiness is overrated" would be funny, as a counterpoint to the enjoy
chapter and emotional mastery. It's overrated for performance and future happiness,
however, it's instant win in the short term.

A lot of people really, really care about how they feel. And yes, for your internal
environment your average emotional state, your quality of life, the quality of emotions that
pop up, and how often and for what duration and intensity they occur in your life, that is
your quality of life. There's something else outside your quality of life. There's the likelihood
that the system you create through behavior enforces those things to be harder or easier to
appear. You might be able to force happiness as a homeless person who's in constant pain,
because you can't afford good medical care, you might be able to do that. However, you
might find it's a lot easier to be happy when you're not in constant pain and you're not
homeless, because you have slightly more money, because you learned a skill that you're
good at that other people aren't that you know. Might even be enjoyable for you to do
something that may not directly give you the same happiness, like controlling your focus
and having positive beliefs, but it surely works, which is why when you interrogate and
question people in regards to their happiness and believe their answers up to 70 grand a
year, you just keep getting happier the more money that you make. At 70 grand it falls off
and it goes negative.

I like the idea of your emotions being your internal environment because just like your
environment in the real world, it is going to trigger you more than you're going to trigger it.




Their environment has a lot more momentum than you do. It's not always easier for it to be
a non-reactive to you than it is for you to be non-reactive to it.

As far as your emotions go, your internal landscape environment is going to be like the
constant operating pressure that you exist under that can cause a movement in direction
that's very nice or a direction that's very slow. It's like walking through mud, deep mud. Or,
having the wind at your back, and all your beliefs and values, and common meanings that
you assign to things, that's what is going to filter all of the new reality that you experience as
you're traveling down the path and it won't always be a path. A lot of times it will be up
against the making a path of your own - trail blazing, they call it.

Those filters of beliefs, values and meanings that you assign are going to change the internal
environment with the matchup between the new things that you run into that are either
inside or coming from the outside, but they're entering your consciousness; either
subconscious or conscious. Once they've gone through that filter, they change the wind,
they change the weather, they change the walking.

Unlike many environments, your internal emotional environment can change in a heartbeat.
Unlike the environment in the real world, in your emotional environment it is you that has
the momentum whereas the environment itself is actually another variable.

Better emotions in your life

Do you want to have better emotions in your life? Great! I want you to sit up in your
chair straight now, breathe deeply and just hold that posture for a minute. I want you
to think of a time when you felt really proud about something, really intense feelings
of pride. You deserve to feel great right now. Feeling great right now, I want you to
think about what would happen if you took the same belief, the same habit of feeling
great and deserving to feel great, and did a little more often in your life. It's only a
couple of sentences of work, and it could pay a lifetime of benefits if you feel like it's a
good thing to throw in there. If you read a book and it just tells you to do a little mind
trick that makes you sit up and feel good, and then you actually follow along which
most people have to. Don't think about a giant pink elephant right now, I command
you, no giant pink elephant thinking! The human brain can't understand that shit, it
has to frame it in the positive, and imagine it.

A very long time ago I came up with this thing called it's a way to be happier more often
nearly free. If you are concerned with the quality of life that you have, the quality of life that
you have is to a large degree the quality of emotions that you have in your life. We don't
have that many words to describe them and we don't even really feel that many core
emotions. Let's talk about food for example. Beef, chicken, steak, fish. There aren't that
many core types of meat. Yes, there's different kinds of birds. Yes, there's different types of
four-legged creatures that are larger and smaller that are tasty. The point is, if you're willing
to categorize emotions reasonably and ask people to write down the emotions they feel in
an average day, you're not going to get more than 12 answers. If it's true that it's only
basically 12 types of feeling you can feel in a day, that's quite wide a range.

Most people's range is much lower than that. Then, the quality of life that you have is based
on the rules you have for that quality. If in order for you to be happy you have to have a six-
pack, 10% body fat, make a million dollars a year, have a model girlfriend, and win a hard



contest that is competitive in any arena once a year, you're fucked. If every single one of
those things is an and statement - this and that and that have to be true for me to be
happy, and if all of those things don't happen, I can't be happy. Then you're fucked because
you set up the rules of the game where you can't win.

As a result, you've got two options. You can either change your rules through effort,
dedication and programming in new rules, or be super human and just hit those metrics all
the time. Good luck with that. You can also change your sampling frequency. You can
change the rate at which you measure how you're matching up on those goals. This is my
invention. If you're happy because you're hearing some great music or something cool is
happening, you lock that shit in and you make no effort to measure anytime soon to see
whether you shouldn't be happy anymore. You prolong the next sample, the frequency, the
rate, the time between this sample and the next one. As soon as you've got a good one, you
slow down your sampling. Ride the dream.

Why not ride that high? Forget that you just lived the dream and join the suck of being
reminded that you're not good enough for this next person when you ask them for the
world and they're not interested in giving you even parts of it? Why would you fuck yourself
over like that? If the mission of doing the thing is to feel important and you already feel
important, why risk that feeling of success you just had.

If the goal is to maintain happiness, then you can greatly increase the chance that you will
remain happy by achieving a high and riding it. If you catch a wave as a surfer, you stay on it
until it's over. You don't try to catch another wave while you're still riding the first awesome
wave that you caught, because you would crash and you would burn. More accurately for
surfers, you would wipe out. If you don't want to wipe out emotionally, do a good thing,
have reasonable goals - hopefully goals within a reasonable range of what you can do so
you can get a taste of success and find the easier way to your next goal. You can just set
smaller goals and do it more frequently instead of setting a goal you can never reach, which
just causes you pain. I never do even close to good enough. I give up. Having goals that are
too large and sampled slowly is not smart. Having goals that are small and sampled quickly is
smart. You get faster rewards. That's why video games are so addictive. You don't have to
wait a year to see whether you beat the boss or not. You fight the boss, you win right now
within 5,10 minutes, maybe an hour or two max.

I've never heard of this system before - I've heard of changing your rules, your beliefs, your
habits, your skills. I've never heard of purposefully manipulating the frequency of which you
measure whether you've met your goals or not. Measure faster when life sucks, so you can
swallow some winds quicker. Measure slower when you've already caught an amazing
wave, if you're trying to optimize for your emotional happiness. If you're not trying to
optimize for that, if you're trying to optimize for just crushing and being the most effective
person in the world, and you're the kind of person that can crush and be effective while sad
or otherwise emotionally screwed up, you might find more performance by not being extra
happy through changing the way you measure whether you should be or not. You might be
the kind of person that can torture themselves into progress and success. Some people are
this way.



I would say most people, when they crush their souls and crush their dreams and make
everything impossible to win, would respond rather reasonably with Fuck this. I would
rather go do something else - nearly anything else, whether it be drink, smoke, blow my ears
out with loud music or blow my brains out with a gun. Fuck all that pressure. The funniest
part is there isn't any pressure. You invent it. There is no actual pressure. You're at one
atmosphere of pressure just like everybody else.


If you want to ride the highs and have a slightly more enjoyable life, ride the highs. Don't
ride them forever. When the wave is over, it's over, but don't jump off of a good wave to
jump back into the horror if you're trying to actually enjoy life. I'm proud that I invented it
on my own and if someone else out there invented it at the same time then congratulations
to you, too. Be proud of yourself as well. Sampling frequency is a totally awesome way to
refer to it. Anyone that's ever had a CD player has been exposed to that word for a long
time. Probably no one knows what the fuck it means, though.


Mindset to feeling

If you ever want a nice excuse to get rid of feeling bad or some emotion, just think about
how non-productive you are and think if you're non-productive anyway, might as well be
happy.

Paul Ekman - Emotions

"For more than 40 years, Paul Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete,
measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most influential work revolved around the
finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were
preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media.
Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct
facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that
matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as
basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprised 21 ] Robert Plutchik agreed with
Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the "wheel of emotions", suggesting eight
primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear;
trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation.^ Some basic emotions can be modified to
form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or
association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary
colors combine, primary emotions could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional
experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt .
Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.^

Two Dimensions of Emotion

Through the use of multidimensional scaling, psychologists can map out similar emotional
experiences, which allows a visual depiction of the "emotional distance" between














experiences.^ a further step can be taken by looking at the map's dimensions of the emotional
experiences. The emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valence (how
negative or positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the
experience feels). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map.GiiThis two-
dimensional map was theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core
affect . bsumi core affect is not the only component to emotion, but gives the emotion its hedonic
and felt energy.

The idea that core affect is but one component of the emotion led to a theory called
"psychological construction/'n^According to this theory, an emotional episode consists of a set
of components, each of which is an ongoing process and none of which is necessary or sufficient
for the emotion to be instantiated. The set of components is not fixed, either by human
evolutionary history or by social norms and roles. Instead, the emotional episode is assembled at
the moment of its occurrence to suit its specific circumstances. One implication is that all cases
of, for example, fear are not identical but instead bear a family resemblance to one another."

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion >

Emotional programming

If you built living things from scratch, how would you program them?

Think about a world where people harm themselves, and don't care to eat or take
care of their kin because of bad emotional programming or adherence to emotional
programming. Those people would all be selected against. The question becomes, if
it's true that everything that's here is here because it was chosen and it worked, then
in what ways do some of the behaviors that are not commonly understood to work
actually cause effectiveness? For instance, violence, pair bonding, jealousy, rage,
frustration (it's a search function), boredom, laziness. You can basically model what
the world might look like if you change the existence or strength of any one of those
emotional variables. You take something that's universally effective, like delayed
gratification, and you wonder how that emotion came into being. For instance like
farming, if you don't farm at the right time, then you don't have food when you need
it. Then there's people that couldn't work where it wasn't obviously necessary, and
would lose productivity to those people that could do work when only it was
necessary in a more hidden and tacit sense.

Emotions are how you got here

Emotions are the programming that allowed the unbroken chain of thousands of
"lovers" to become your ancestors. If one single pair of people in that chain didn't
raise their children to the point where they could find a partner of their own and raise
chilldren to do the same, you wouldn't exist to read this right now. This is also the
reason that you feel so strongly about the oppposite sex. It's the pull of your
ancestors, and the same effective programming that served them for those many
thousands of years.

Don't be the weakest link

Make babies, or make sure your ok with being the last of a hundred thousand
year chain of successful parents.

If you don't feel that pull, then you might be executing the variety strategy,
which means that we must be different than our ancestors, for the robust







species wins in the long run over the super specialized species. Being an
omnivore is hugely adventageous.


If your programming for variety has led you to not have sex with the opposite
gender, then you might be the end of your chain. Maybe you can cheat by being
a sperm donor, or artificial insemination, but the odds are that you'll just be the
last of your lineage.

It's a funny way to look at the paths we find ourselves on. Either you're doing
difference from your ancestors for robustness, or you're doing the same stuff,
because it's known to work. You can't really escape the paradigm. If you look at
spiders, they often make exactly the same pattern of webs that their parents
made, even though they've never met them. Some creatures are born with less
desire to be novel, or break the model so to speak. We as humans are probably
the most likely to try different things of any living thing we're aware of. Have
you ever seen reports of men who just can't stop having sex with the tailpipes of
cars, a very strange auto-erotica, so to speak? How often have you seen other
animals trying to have sex with a car? We surely are pushing the limits of having
kids with whatever we can. If there's ever a fertility treatment for steel and
aluminum, we might have a car population explosion.

Thus, your spirit, your feelings, the programming which has served the 10's of
thosands of men and women that ate, made love, and made sure you ancestors
ate and made love and were safe until you were old enough to have sex and
perpetuate the process. That programming, that giant long unbroken chain that
results in you here reading my words, that is the real decider of what you will
become, what your actual soul is.

Programming exists without software and hardware, take a look at any rube Goldberg
machine or windmill, that's also programming.

The programming that governs our behaviors: Mood and Emotion

The programming that governs our behavior isn't needs, it's mood and emotion.

Needs is just a weird combination of certain selected emotions that is not accurate.

We come programmed with some pretty great software

I’ve got some great news, we come with some pretty great software. For the well and
normally programmed of us, lying feels really bad, keeping secrets is hard, we want
people to like us, we get bored, we want to travel.

Variance leads to excellence

I don't particularly like when the truth leads to ethical or moral places that I'm not too
happy with. For instance, you're on the edge, 50/50 between being gay and being
straight. If you flop towards the straight side, you have kids and your genes go on. If
you flop to the gay side, you get off that gene pool.

There's a very strong evolutionary advantage to flipping on the side of disliking
homosexuality, because at least in some rare cases, it'll flip you to the side of
preferring chicks to dudes, or at least get you to try that behavior a couple more
times, that might lead to kids.



Should people be able to love whatever they want? Probably, within the parameters
of the law. Then, should people get hated on for the choices they make? No, not
really. Should everyone understand why disliking gay stuff has been selected for by
reality? Not by us, not by evil, just by it's what happens to create more of us. Since
we're what's left, the only stuff that's worked in the 99,9 percent of permanent
extinction. You kind of got to feel for both sides.

The stupid people that may not have too many tools to help manage who and what
they are, and what they do, they are executing an effective strategy that, if for some
reason they were born on the fence, they might flop to the side of having kids, and
you have to honor that intention. Then you also have gay people, because you can't
program humans perfectly and we have to have variation for evolution, they're just
doing the best they can, too. They just happen to sometimes be girls in guys bodies, or
guys or girls bodies or choose a certain aesthetic over another.

Thus, you've got two different systems, both trying to create people, and more
effective people. In this case, they have conflict, and it creates basically an eternal
conflict. 50/50 will always happen. Choosing straight over gay works, disliking gay
helps that happen. Disliking gay gets selected for.

Having variation leads to excellence and durability, so they get selected for, and part
of variation is liking different stuff. I guess there's always going to be conflict in this
area. It's two conflicting behaviors that are both getting selected for.

By the way, if you have more execution of gay stuff in your crew or tribe of humans,
that may appear as a sign of weakness to other tribes of humans, and they may decide
to attack you first to take your shit. It's not just selected for at the individual level.

Important to note under the evolutionary selection stuff, that robustness and the
ability to adapt vastly outperforms specialization and niche filling over time.

Perceptual excellence

Remember to include squinting as a natural response to things being unclear, head
bobbing, head movement. This is the reason the birds bob their heads around and
those things being related to the emotional programming for perceptual excellence.
Color response

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism (fear of colors that indicate "don't try
eating me")

Animals are great at lots of stuff we're not. You wouldn't want to get into an arm
wrestling match with a similarly sized ape, because it's muscles attach at different
spots to its bones, and therefore it will easily destroy your arm, and maybe eat your
face to teach you a lesson about interprimate respect.

Cats can hear up to 60k hz, we can only hear up to 20k. We can see about 10 million
colors with our eyes, lizards, frogs, birds and bugs can see about 100 million.

Emotional fitness

Seek love but don't chase it



Either get some love in your life, make that constant distraction dissipate, or see it as
a distraction and focus on it later. If it's a goal, it's a great goal, if it’s in the way, it’s in
the way big time. Or, maybe you aren't so passionate or hormonal, and thus less
controlled by your baser impulses.

Positive Emotions
Joy
Love

Appreciation/Gratitude

Appreciation is the only true wealth

Since gratitude is a key to happiness, it's good to honor those that we owe so
much. Rarely have I ever heard anyone genuinely exclaim how lucky they felt
that the road was paved, or that they had such a great language available to
them that they didn't even need to invent. Thank god for the toilet. Best
invention ever.


Passion

Courage

True Courage

I would call it courage. It takes courage to jump out into the unknown and say
You know what, I'm going to quit my job, going to eat through my life savings
and I might only improve the outcome 5% by finding the right doctor, or I could
only improve the outcome by 5% by learning about one of these guys, who has
limited availability getting you a time slot before someone else that didn't try as
hard. That willingness to sacrifice the 150-200,000 of money you may have
made in whatever job you have in order to get that 5% chance in your life, that
takes courage. It takes creativity to know that it's an option, and it takes
courage to do whatever no one else has ever shown you what to do. If it were
common that as soon as you get cancer everyone that loves you quits their jobs
and only focuses on your wellness, then it would be a lot easier to do because
you'd have a role model for it. I don't think many people have that role model
experience because they don't have the financial freedom to do it.

Having the courage to endure pain to save energy for breakthrough

Enduring pain in order to stash up enough energy to make a breakthrough
to then have overwhelming success is like holding your breath before a
dive, sucks while you're doing it but it's the only way you can get low
enough and get back with enough oxygen. Take whatever you want at the
bottom of your dive up to the top and enjoy it. During the suck of getting
no rewards or people telling you what you're doing is stupid is kind of
what's required to make the breakthrough, to get to the place that they
would never have the courage to get.

Enthusiasm
Positive expectations
Optimism
Helpfullness
Contentment



Negative Emotions
Boredom

Boredom

Behavioral benefits of boredom

Boredom exists to make us do something new. Associations exist so that
you could not stay at home and lay in bed all day long. It just stopped
working, people are tired. A lot of researchers believe that such behaviors
evolve because they provide you with great benefits. They haven't
appeared at the same pace as the world did. For example, now we've got
an obesity epidemic because calories are more available than ever before.

Ever notice you get bored of things, no matter what the thing is - video
game, people. Hell, even violence gets boring, why is that? I think it's a
really interesting optimization to prevent processing loops where you
can't ever get free. Boredom should seriously be looked at in
programming and machine learning the same way that it has paid off for
us. I would guess that boredom is a simple way to maintain search space
width instead of depth. Boredom works great when there are lots of
smaller problems and places to search with good payoff, and when the
payoffs happen early, or not at all. When the things you need to beat
require tons and tons of deliberate effort, then boredom is your enemy.

Pessimism (Can be used as a productivity technique)

Frustration (Not always negative)

Frustration is like a search function

Frustration emotionally is like a programming function where you have to
decide how far down a path to go before you realize it's a failure. In the real
world, if you actually walk down a path to see what's at the end of it, whatever
time you spend going down that path, assuming you aren't tired or the
environment hasn't changed, is going to take the same amount of time to get
back to where you started. Every minute you walk in a direction is going to take
you a minute to get back. This assumes that you have to reach the same starting
point in order to start to have a new path, which surely isn't always the case,
but is pretty common (in a wooded area where you need trails). Frustration is
an emotion which is basically a halting, it makes you stop what you are doing,
and try something else.

If you change the level, speed or intensity to which a person feels frustration,
what you are actually doing is putting a limit on the depth of their search
function. Or, if you don't want to call it a search function, you could call it an
experiment function whereby which they are attempting to do something,
which didn't previously exist or they didn't have the knowledge of, or they
weren't good at. Then at some point you decide that we've got the diminishing
returns out of this thing, we are as good as we are reasonably going to be in this
time frame, let's switch to something else, how do we affect that change? You
could really hate the first thing or you could really like the next thing. The
problem is that the next thing is like this infinite set of all things possible,
whereas the first thing is just one thing. It's much easier to cause the switch by



causing a distaste for the first thing than it is to try and look into the vastness of
everything, and hope that it draws you away from the thing that has consumed
your consciousness in the last five or ten minutes.

You will find that the amount of minutes and strength to which human beings
feel frustration is probably due to the level of difficulty in tasks in the years past
back, when our emotions really evolved with our desire for fats and sugars etc. I
wouldn't be surprised if the vast majority of tasks existed during that formative
period. That's actually a misleading term, we are still being formed just as much
now, if not more. For the purposes of this argument, well just say formative
period. If you looked from an outside perspective at those people having the
problems that they did at that time, you would find that the frustration timing
and intensity matched pretty closely with the difficulty of achieving whatever
task might have been at hand, whether it was to plant a seed, get a monkey to
stop stealing your food or keep the other cave guys out of your cave chick. I
don't know if we will ever have the opportunity to ever look at that, because
progress is happening ever so quickly that based on our own technological
innovation, the natural biological kind is going to be outpaced.

Disappointment

Blame

Revenge

Hatred

Jealousy

Fear (Can be used effectively)

Anxiety

If you are anxious, ask yourself What could it be that you are overvaluing or
undervaluing?

Insecurity

Guilt

Depression

Your mood and emotions
Jealousy

Everyone is cheating, so don't be too jealous

If you're ever curious why the world is so beautiful, so skinny and so fit, so
energetic, guess what? Just like you discover all the athletes of the world are
doping and cheating, everyone else in the world is cheating, too. Look at all of
the drugs that are getting sold. All the diet pills, all the Botox, all of the
surgeries, all of the steroids, you name it. Those multi-billion dollar industries,
they have customers, and the customers, guess who? They are all those people
that you look at, and wonder how did they do that?

Evolutionary psychology

If you believe that physical traits evolved, like monkeys having longer arms to be
better at maneuvering in trees and reaching branches farther way, how could you not
believe that his emotions had to evolve as well to make him even look up at the tree
and decide that was a place where he would want to climb the trunk to get to the
limbs anyway? The motivation and desire to use the physical tools of his body is



equally important. Imagine what use those long arms would be if his emotions instead
evolved to go swimming. He'd be destroyed by crocodiles and sharks. All of our
emotions are as, if not more, evolved that our bodies.

Rain is okay

Any time that you want to feel better about the rain, just remember the trees got to
eat.

Expressing emotions

We all laugh, cry and facially signal the same

http://www.science20.com/news releases/blind people use same emotional

expressions because they are innate not learned study

Frustration is a halt command. Anger is a follow command

Frustration makes you stop interacting with whatever you're doing. It's the
opposite of anger. Anger laser focuses you in on a single thing and gives you
tunnel vision. If you see people maniacally laughing with a master plan and you
wonder what it is that drives them and how they're able to achieve so much
more than anyone else, it's through rage. An all-consuming fucking anger and
rage for vengeance.


Spirit Mind

Happiness

Optimizing for happiness

Happiness is not the best target. Let's be serious, if you only want happiness out of
this life, you're not asking for much.

Some argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires
because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as
the Three Mile Island effect.^ Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to
assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether,
ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests
that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented
future serious incidents.

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism >

I'd add here that the question is poorly formed, as there is no such thing as good or
bad, unless you include when and whom. As most things that are good or bad are
sometimes one way in the short term, and another in the long term, and always
different based on the party to whom they're occurring, to leave out those obvious
variables is negligent. They're obvious, unavoidable and super important, nearly
impossible to not measure things. Wrong for whom, with what objective, at what
time? It isn't perfect, but god damn it's a lot better. Why the hell are all these
utilitarians trying to optimize for people they don't care about? There's no universal
good in resource allocation with infinite human desire and limited real resources.

When bad things happen, they might be good in the long run, so do you focus on the
short term and feel bad, or on the long term and feel good? Or do you fuck yourself
the hardest and focus on the loss now. Then in the future, when the payoff has kicked
in, just refocus back to the past. You can still feel the suck.








With more complex systems, you have to be creative and wise to guess what the
future will look like. As a matter of fact, it's so hard that we will pay you thousands of
millions of dollars. That is, if you can accurately predict the future values of things. Go
take out a call or put option on margin in any market, at perhaps forty to one
leverage. Now if you're right, you make forty times your money. If you're wrong
though, you lose the same amount.

Since certainty is expensive to find, even where it can be found at all, you might take
the easy payoff of having a positive outlook. The more comfortable you are with
uncertainty, the more joy you will have in your life. When you aren't comfortable with
uncertainty, your body and your mind will put you in an unattractive state of stress.
You will tunnel vision on that which sucks and it will destroy your quality of life. Focus
on what you want. Let your life be filled with adventure you travel through
appreciatively. Reject the commonly taken path of stress and worry. If stress and
worry paid better dividends, they could be considered. They take you farther from
where you want to be, and lock you in a state of inaction. The coward dies a thousand
deaths.

Why are all these philosophers trying to optimize happiness? If we were meant to be
happy more often, we fucking would be. Being more happy leads to less effectiveness
in the ways that we're used to doing it. The tortured soul must create to relieve his
pain. The man or woman raised without love must lash out at the world in revenge or
find a way to get that love he was so deprived, much of the greatness that we have in
this world is the result of need, not want. Happy people have not need. Happy
people's cups flowed over. It is that removal of need to destroys the common mans
need to pursue happiness.

If you are already happy, why bust your ass in pursuit? Save the calories. A happy
person probably executes his morality on others less often, and allows the suck to
creep into the world, he doesn't want to lose his happy buzz by having to hack at evil
with a hatchet. Better to assume that evil person over there doing evil things is really
just like me inside, and they'll see a better way, somehow, hopefully. Hope into one
hand, shit into the other, see which fills faster.

Happy and effective can be done, however, as long as effective is a competition
among men, and as long as happy removes the need to compete, pre-happy people
will be outperformed by post-happy people, for they MUST perform, whereas the pre-
happy, might, or might not, he can only lose by playing, for he's already emotionally
won. The unhappy person has nothing to lose in the hunt, only gain, for he's already in
the shit, and see light at the end of the tunnel.

Now these kind of analogies aren't the kind I like to make, for as many colors as there
are in the rainbow - there's many, many more ways to be human, and feel about
things and operate. However, I'm pretty certain that if you looked at those humans
who gave the most to the world they left behind death, I think you'll find they were
described as more happy than anything else much more rarely than other emotions
such as driven, or focused, etc. Thus, I feel quite comfortable putting the fate of



mankind in the hands of those who must win, and not those for whom winning is only
an option. One day happy effective might be common, that would be great. As it
stands, happily effective is an end I put after effective. If you really want happiness
first, just keep lowering your standards and your salvation can be found in a day.

Be reasonable with your happiness, it's a tool, like all the other tools you've been born
with. Emotions work, and they work well, for what they've evolved to do. When you
start fucking with them, without honoring their original intentions and reasons for
being, you're likely to find out the other people with the old programming are going to
outcast you, punish you, and take advantage of your pretty new system of happiness
no matter what. I know where I grew up, if you were struck in the face, and turned the
other cheek and smiled, your ass would be beat until they could figure out what
exactly was wrong with you, for what could be more interesting than a person you
could beat, and they actually enjoy it? Well, see, now you're getting your ass kicked
constantly, and to the casual observer, you've found a way to love it so that's great.
Now some other poor kid doesn't has to get his ass kicked when he wouldn't have
enjoyed it, you're here to be the whipping boy of the neighborhood.

You could honor the world in the way that it's been most responsive to, and do tit-for-
tat strategy where you give as well as you get, or perhaps better. The world becomes
a better place. Tit-for-tat is the most effective thing we've found, and it's literally how
we hand out and authorize use of force by the government, you commit a harsher
wrong, you receive a harsher punishment, that's tit for tat. Perhaps your fighting back
is getting someone in the state to retaliate for you through the use of law, that's fine
too. The point is, when you try to cheat the nice social system that we live in, by
taking more happiness than is reasonable, you will be punished for it. Your fellow man
will make sure that you don't get the happiness he's felt deprived of so easily if he can
find a reasonable way to market hat happen. There's a reason vandalism and mischief
is so common among men, and it's because it's effective. If you break everyone else's
shit, the things you have are more valuable. Every experimental non tit for tat way of
interacting with others has been shown to get abused by others that notice that they
can get free profit out of the deal.

Now, if you just kept that happiness inside, and didn't leak it out of your face harming
all the jealous fools who gazed upon you, you could keep much of the upside of an
inner peace and joy without getting the beat downs, you could even advertise tit for
tat, but in reality not follow through, like many animals mimic poisonous animals,
when they actually aren't themselves. They get the benefits the poisonous creatures
do, without the effort it takes to actually be poisonous. It works for animals for
millions of years, it might work for you, too. Hell, that's how the speeding tickets
work, right? The sign says that if you go over the limit, you’ll probably get a ticket, but
you know you most of the time really won't, and thus the highway itself is a mimicking
poisonous animal; sometimes you will get bit, sometimes you won't, is it worth the
risk? Many tend to follow the speed limit, because to know the difference between
the day you will get caught for speeding and the day that you won't is too hard to tell
and too expensive to risk, just like toying with the snake that you can't tell whether it's
a real venomous coral snake or the harmless "red milk snake" that’s just like it.



Sun Tzu said that all war is deception, and that book has been a best seller for 2500
years. Kind of makes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception in animals even more
interesting. Think of all the instances we use in our own armed services the same
tactics that animals have been using for millions of years. If you are weak, attempt to
look strong, if you are strong, attempt to look weak (angler fish). If you are near, try to
seem far. This is what camouflage does, it lets you grab your prey from an angle
they're weak from, like an octopus grabbing a crap from behind. If you are far, try to
seem near.

Remember here, some of these things only work during times of war. During a non¬
war time you're always better off looking stronger instead of weaker. Looking weaker
invites war. A good tool used at the wrong time is the wrong tool. Learn from the
animals, learn from Sun Tzu.

Enjoy not being happy

You're supposed to cycle into and out of happiness, just like sleep, just like eating, just
like breathing, in and out. The sooner you worry a little bit less about how happy you
are, the sooner you get a little free happiness. Maybe it's ok to be grumpy, maybe you
like being grumpy. It could be a good deal for you, or you could be doing grumpy
wrong, personality is an art.

Fuck optimizing for happiness

I haven't produced anything for the world in 12 years since I left the company that I
ran, with 150 employees. I beat myself up about it rather regularly because I'm not
doing what I should do. I'm not doing what I should do and that I should be benefiting
the world. I'm talking about the very specific: I need to organize my book. I need to
write one chapter and then the next chapter. All the things I know I need to do that
are very specific and that’s just book related shit. I’ve got similar things with different
business ideas. I've got similar things with my personal health. I am a cluster-fuck of
disappointment when I measure what I am doing - to what I could be doing.

We all have a way to do something we know we shouldn't be doing. For some people
it's drinking. Then you come back and you're still there. There's a time for partying,
there's a time for doing the things that you enjoy and I will tell you that those times
are after you have got something working while you're sleeping, it's just too powerful.
It's too powerful to skip.

Now theoretically, you could theoretically be happy and productive. I think that I
could strategize a way to do that. All it would require is a little bit of social reward,
and I would be good to go, but without that social award, living in a goddamn vacuum
beating myself up all the time. The more opportunity I have in the future, the more
pain I'll have, because the more mistakes I make, because I'm pushing harder. I made
this analogy before: if you're a car and you're not moving, you're not going to see any
bugs in your window, but if you're going a million miles an hour, flying through life,
you're going to have a windshield full of fucking bugs. You got to choose. You want to
be a shooting star or do you want to be a fucking stone?

Some people, they want to optimize for happiness. My experience and from what I've
seen, it just leads to fucking loserness. If you ask Barack Obama if he's happy as the
president of the United States, I'm going to tell you fucking no. If you asked Tony



Robbins if he's happy, he's the best personal development life coach on the planet,
the most wealthy and successful success person. If you're in the business of search
engine optimization and you don't rank number one for search engine optimization,
fuck you. If you're in the business of self-help and you aren't the most helped by your
own self, fuck you. It's self-referential, it's meta, it's recursive. He should be happy,
he's not a award winning artist like Picasso. If I'm so lucky to find happiness before
productivity, fabulous. I'm not optimizing for happy.

Consciousness (Awareness)

Consciousness is like a color, a human construct

I believe that consciousness is like color, it's a human construct, it's a human way of
understanding things, so it's profitable. It turns out that in the real world, color
doesn't exist, in the real world there's no blue, there's no red, there's no green, you
only think there's blue, red, and green because your brain decided it was a useful way
to organize the perception of different wavelengths of light. Different wavelengths of
light do exist, and different materials refract the light from the sun and other sources
into our photoreceptors in our eyes, in varying degrees depending on the wavelength
of the light, and that's all great. But that's just a human construct, right? The same
way your brain is deleting you seeing your blinking, you don't notice every time you
blink, the same way that you don't notice you can always actually see your nose, is the
same way that you think that there's this consciousness thing, and it's important. But
in reality, it's just a phenomena of belief that's profitable and useful. However, just
like color, it doesn't really exist. I would go as far as to say that consciousness doesn't
actually exist, you just think it does, the same way that color doesn't actually exist,
you just think it does. Can you still make great discoveries and useful things in life by
thinking colors exist? Hell yeah, sure you can. It's very useful, but when it stops
becoming useful, feel free to stop using it.

The Consciousness Economy

Sales and Marketing people have power over your consciousness

If it's true that the most rare and valuable thing in the world is human consciousness,
and sales people affect human consciousness, then sales people are pretty powerful.
Furthermore, sales people and comedians are constantly refining their craft,
mastering better timing and better wording to maximize the amount of response that
they get and their target audience.

Advertising for people to do the wrong thing

If you're advertising for people to do the wrong thing, you're killing the mother
earth that birthed you. You're killing the system you live in. You're making the
world that you live in, a worse place. To some degree, that shittiness will come
back to you. Probably nowhere near as close to the profit you make on causing
it, sadly. That's the tragedy of the commons. If somebody gets to externalize the
cost of destroying the environment and make extra profit, that's a great idea for
them. (Xx This goes in "the world" as well)

Self-consciousness

Self-consciousness just means that instead of operating at your meta level, you can
now see above you that there’s another meta level with people walking around on it,
and a glass floor, and you can then hop up there and then back down into the minds
of other players, you could call that empathy. The issue is, why should you care to fuck



over dolphins, because they can't see that one level higher? The issue is that the
whole empathy thing is more important for team effectiveness than it is important for
calling to some sense of fairness, team beats fair. Fair is kind of the weak flour that
makes the team cake. Flour can be ok, but given the choice, you take the cake.

Thus, stop being a dick in regards to other animals having emotions, they do, and even
if they didn't, you would get the profit from the rest of the people in your society of
them not thinking you were a psycho and might kill them, by treating those non next
level up seeing things as things to be treated nice. For as I said before, it’s less
important the concept of fairness, and more important the team effect.

Consciousness isn’t really a thing

Consciousness, you think it exists, it doesn't actually exist. It's useful to think it does
though. It's like Fuchsia:

C3534I 1 day ago H

Fuchsia is not a combination of pink and purple. It is the color your brain comes up
with when it sees contradictory color signals (such as very high and very low
wavelengths without the appropriate middle stimulation). It's the only color not in
the rainbow. As you can see from this additive color program
( http://trvcolors.com/?trv=l&ffb5d9=0&c31cff=0) . pink and purple create a
lavender color. Whereas fuscia is what happens when you combine colors in an
unusual way ( http://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/ColoredShad...)

From < https://news.vcombinator.com/item?id=12271354 >
jpfed 1 day ago H

To be yet more pedantic, it's the only fully-saturated color that's not present in
the rainbow.

Colors are perceptual phenomena- the interpretation of a spectrum of light
impinging on a patch of retina that almost invariably contains more than one
frequency at a time. Colors include white, black, gray, pink, tan, beige, baby blue-
none of which are in the rainbow.

Awareness

Understanding the present

It's funny, why try to understand the ancient when you don't understand the present.
Would you rather beat up the guy beating you, or some other person in the past,
while your ass is getting kicked?

Mindfullness

The magic of mindfulness

In your life, you don't remember everything, you really only remember moments.
Your memory is like any other muscle, it gets better with use. The more you journal
the truly beautiful things that have happened in your life, the quicker you will be able
to recall them, and the more of a positive effect they will have on your existence. For
instance, if you win a very competitive game of something, it feels really, really,
wonderful for a moment, perhaps hours, but the feeling wears off, not because it has
to, but because you call it less and less into your memory (and human beings have a
satiation point for everything). I think the reason winners look and act like winners is
because they've won so many times, that they are very ready to fall right into their
I have won - mode, even if they haven't yet, because their focus is on what they are
used to (winning) and you see and feel it in their presence. The converse is true about









losers. Thus, you must keep a daily journal of your magic moments (and set out to
create new magic moments) because they are what life and your memory is made of.
Open up your book sometime and take a good whiff of all the beautiful things that
have happened in your life. Don't let them disappear just so you can let your memory
get rusty.

Create a reverse journal highlighting all the beautiful things you can remember about
your life before this date, because if you don't, one day you will not be able to
remember them, and they will truly be lost forever (unless you are lucky enough for
someone else to have done this work for you).

Complain less

Complaining is describing an event in a negative tone with no indication of next steps
to fix.

React less
Practice gratitude
Honoring our predecessors

Now we live in mega cities, and you have the option of living in a house someone else
built, eating delicious food someone else prepared, and watching a mirror as someone
else cuts your hair with expert precision. How is this possible? Specialization. People
get good at a couple things instead of being bad or average at lots of things. The end
result is that all the goods and services we enjoy today are better than they could ever
be if you had to do it all yourself. Imagine if you had to invent your own language to
speak! We stand on the backs of giants. The masses and masses of our ancestors who
fought, lived and died so that we could have the life and lifestyles we have today.
Honor the past and honor the memory of all those that died and fought so hard to
allow you the privilege of living this fine life.

Appreciate more

Make a habit of appreciating the small things in life
Thank one person per day
Emotions are faster than thought.

Literally, it’s closer to the stem of your brain than all the fancy thinking things, and so
it's slower to react and trasmit commands. And it should be.


You

Values

Value yourself over others most of the time - you are important

If you're not willing to cut your arm off to feed other people, then by golly perhaps
you're not willing to just give away other things you own to them either. Perhaps
executing that obvious fact is why nearly all the good stuff on this planet is the result
of men organized in businesses with ownership and property enforced. As long as
everything good in the world is made in that way, then you should find a way to do
more of what works faster, than doing what doesn't work, and hasn't worked for the
most part, throwing money into places where it isn’t used properly.

I don't think it's an accident that businesses beat the living shit out of selfless
endeavors for making the world a better place. It's damn near literally no comparison
at all. Remember one laptop per child ? Ever see one? Ever touch one? Ever use one?
And that was one of the better ideas! The free market is the most powerful way we've



found to fulfill the desires of the masses. Not the needs, but the desires. Getting them
to desire what they should desire is currently their own problem, and the intelligent
marketers in the world are usually working against the consumers' best interests. I
think these days the marketers are winning big time over the wholesome individuals
ideal behaviors.

Call what the world is marketing out there what you like, I can tell you that if you
designed the system from the ground up yourself, you'd probably not have everyone
spending large percentages of their conscious life putting on a false face, hair, smell,
etc., to trick their fellow man. It's kind of like the cold war? If everyone would chill out
with the arms race, everyone could relax a bit, and our desires would renormalize, you
know, back like everyone was still quite horny when pubic hair still existed. For those
of you that haven't gotten out and about in the world these days, there's so little
pubic hair in western culture, that the crab louse that used to infect that area on use
are going extinct.

Now, Wikipedia says that there's no data for it, but noticing the recent hairless trend,
the crab louse would have to be going homeless at an alarming rate, if they need hair
to live in. Now Wiki says they can't tell because governments don't track it, and I
would tell you they're likely not trying hard enough, because sales figures for common
treatments, or surveying primary care physicians or students regarding the status of
that ailment should be little different from the queries they execute for other
ailments, STDs and drug use? If you're curious, just ask.

I can't think of a compelling reason that the destruction of this creature's habitat
would have effects any dissimilar than the many other creatures who've had their
habitats destroyed, except of course that these things are blood sucking parasites, so
good riddance.

More at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective altruism

This shit is wrong, very wrong, for the fact they're cool with me and my loved ones
dying earlier, because they value the far future, and its people at much higher values
than is reasonable. Fuck the far future, if they make it great, I'm not going to kill
myself for them. I don't know those fucks. If someone else wants to take the hit, and
give their money to the future instead of the living here and now, well, I'd try to lobby
them not to.

Now, if they couldn't be lobbied to help out my team, then sure, extinction level
events would be a cool way to invest, better than hedonism from the perspective of
my team's wellbeing. Now, serious, what the hell use is it to care about the very far
future. If you're going to care about people and places that aren't you, and may never
happen, and you're willing to fuck yourself over in that pursuit, then just look even
farther past the next 100,000 years. The universe will expand and collapse, or there's
a multiverse, you name it, the dinosaurs extinction in part allowed us to exist, and
perhaps the best thing for these fantasy things that you simply care about need you to




die off optimally anyway, because you're using up all the nice fossil fuels they needed
to jump start their evolution.


A slippery and stupid slope it is to care about the people so very far in the future. Let's
say, however, that you did care about raw numbers and masses of people coming
after you, shouldn't you be fucking everything that moves and maximizing your child
output? The Quiverfull Christian sect does exactly that, pumps out the maximum
number of kids possible. Hell, if you really care about the largest biomass of humans in
the future, you should probably outlaw contraception as well. Might make procreating
required by law and punishable by death perhaps, that should help expand the
population too.

How stupid...

Every sperm isn't sacred, boys, and much of the effort you put into the future fiction
fantasy world will kill progress that could be made in the next 20-40 years. Focus on
the problems you actually have. Focus on getting to the gym and lifting the weights
and eating right. Don't worry about how you'll fit through doorways when you're
bigger and stronger than Arnold Schwarzenegger was - you won't be. You're solving a
problem you're never going to have. Solve the problems in order. Solve the damn
problems you MUST solve to earn your next problem even existing. Solve today's
problems today.

They say the coward dies a thousand deaths, because he feels fear and imagines his
terrible fate often, thus destroying what could be a good life if he had some courage.
The courageous man dies only once. Stop being a pussy in regards today's problems
by time-shifting your focus to the fantasy problems of the future. You'll find that a lot
of those problems may solve themselves in ways that you couldn't have predicted.
Imagine if you were spending big money on punch cards and vacuum tubes, you'd
have wasted time perhaps optimizing for technology that paradigm shifts made
useless. I'm not sure what the correct way to get people to care more about
themselves and their families and the here and now, and not people thousands of
years from now is. It's like people choosing the imaginary people of Narnia or some
other fiction novel over the real living people of this world. Fuck the fiction people,
we'll deal with them when they're closer to existing.


Greed

Behaviors that aren't selfful enough are self-extinguishing. It is the reason that you see
the same social behaviors that you see in animals. If you want to take advantage of
collectivism as an animal, you need to be part of the group, and you need to perform
in social bonding experiences, if you become socially defective you will be kicked out
of the group. For this reason, you see animals mostly working only with other animals
they can have synergy with.

If an animal decided that it would do without food or mating, so that some other
animal could, that behavior would self-extinguish itself out of the next generation,
because over time, even small optimizations that are helpful are selected for. Fucking
yourself over to benefit someone else that is either useless to you, or even worse,



wants to harm you, is self-extinguishing behavior, and is the reason that pacifists are
by far the minority in behavior strategy both among humans and most other
creatures. Any creature that has a territory by definition will fight to keep it.

Any creature that values pair bonding will by definition fight to keep its partner from
getting raped. Any behavior that fucks you over but doesn't have an equal or greater
side benefit somewhere else to you or someone like you will be selected against and
disappear over time.

Equality, the myth

Equality doesn't exist, not even two foot long rulers are the same size. If they appear
the same size or weight to you, it's only because you are bad at measuring things.

Since two pieces of matter cannot occupy the same space at the same time, by
definition everything is not equal, because everything is closer to some things and
farther from other things. There are other situations where humans try to force
equality where it would actually do harm. If you take the concept of pair bonding for
social mating and rearing of children, when you remove specialization and attempt to
make both members of the party good at the same things, you sacrifice the breadth of
ability that comes from specializing in different areas. Men are supposed to do the
heavy lifting, quite literally, that is why their muscles are bigger. Women are supposed
to do the breastfeeding, that is why their tits make milk. The hunt for equality where
there should be specialization does harm, not good.

The art is to avoid thinking that specialization is subjugation. Different doesn't imply
hierarchy. In some places hierarchy is surely implied, however. Who should do the
fighting? Men or women? Hand to hand combat? Who looks more able? Who wins in
these matches in the real world?

Usually, equality exists, in theory. If I push this direction, there's an equal and opposite
force. Equality is useful for physics, equality is useful for finding things that are similar.
Oh look! There's broken glass here. Hey, maybe there's broken glass there, too,
because this floor looks the same and it's the same room, so maybe there's broken
glass everywhere. You must be a believer in equality to execute reciprocity and if your
other team mates that you're interacting with realize that you're a scumbag that
doesn't believe in reciprocity, they will punish you. You will get fucked over for trying
to gain the system. When you cut in line, everyone hates you because they knew you
cut in line. They will, given the ease of retaliation, fuck you up. Has to be easy, but
they will do it.

I will tell you that in the search for equality, trying to make all lifestyle paths the same
is pretty stupid, all lifestyles paths are not the same. If you do heroin, your lifestyle
path that you have chosen is pretty stupid, and you are going to bring a lot of pain to
yourself and to anyone else around you, and your life is likely to be very, very short,
because you chose the wrong path. If you chose ultraviolent dictator, you're going to
die pretty early. If you chose to be the president of America, your lOOx more likely to
die than the average person. Those people get assassinated all the time. A lot of the
decisions you make that you want to think are equal because of some desire to be fair
to the world is a disservice to those around you and yourself.



All choices are not the same, all paths are not the same. I hate having to spend so
much time on better and worse exists, that different exists, but the whole world is so
trapped in finding equality where it doesn't fucking exist, they forgot better and worse
exist.

Tell me if equality exists, what is a Michelin star rating? Why do people use brands?
Why do they Choose cheerios instead of tasteless oats that suck? Why do they listen
to god damn songs? Equality doesn't exist, competition exists. Competition is where
shit that sucks gets demolished by the thing that's good.

If you think equality exists it's because you are bad at measuring. Two rulers are not
the same size, you just think they are because your measuring tools suck. If you are
able to create equality at such a high degree, at such a high level you positively impact
everyone else, because now people know that’s possible.

If everyone's life is worth the same value, then what is a nation-state, and what is a
family? It's quite obvious we hold different standards for those people which you
exclude out of your, not only personal living quarters, but anywhere near you

If you knew how much time I spent convincing people that better and worse actually
exists, it seems to me slightly absurd that people are so cowardly and so fearful of
finding better in their life that they're willing to brainwash and convince themselves
that better doesn't even exist, can't be measured and therefore whatever they're
doing is already awesome because there's no such things as better, just different.
That's pretty fucking stupid. Computers are better calculators than abacuses, OLED
screen is better than the LCD screen, and if you want shit to last a long time, the pen is
better than the pencil; a and if you want to make loud music, speakers are better than
yelling. Better and fucking worse exists. Whereas I started out saying by explaining
how stupid it is that I have to establish that better and worse even exists to then move
on to try and describe what better might look like, I'm going to change my position on
this. I'm not going to take whiny irritated complaint about the world position. I'm
going to take an advanced, how lucky are you that you get to build free yes
momentum and free authority by building off of something simple that these people
already actually know to be true. And so, how luck are you that you can win a
seemingly contentious point easily by showing that better and worse obviously exists
and then building upon it for your next thing. So, you had to build yes momentum
anyway. You had to get them to pre-commit to agree with you anyway by finding that
first common ground. How lucky are you that the first common ground is so easy to
find?

If you want to talk about how unfair the world is, someone designed it so that two
pieces of matter couldn't exist at the same space, at the same time. You mean literally
there's an enforced uniqueness of one thing per location, how can that possibly be
fair? That thing's location has got to be slightly better or worse than someone else’s.
Fucking time and space itself starts out as unfair so stop looking for fairness.

Finnish women live on average 6 years longer than men. That’s 77.8 to 83.8 years.
Where’s the Scandinavian equality everyone is clamoring for?



The silly search for equality and other pattern finding tendencies, often you will see
patterns where none exist. It can be useful and it can be harmful. The lion is not the
tiger and the antelope is neither still. No one cares about those fat off years. Everyone
cares about today, so let's make today kick ass. Let's work on vanity for fun. If girls can
pay thousands a month to plaster over wrinkling skin, they can surely pay to have
genuinely wrinkle free skin without the makeup.

The fallacy of do onto others as you would have them do on to you

We are not all the same, we should not all be treated the same. Some things that you
would love, others would hate, roller coasters, gluten, etc.

When you're looking at economic policies, or policies in general really, it's a little bit
stupid to want the same things for everyone else that you want of yourself. Take for
instance inflation vs deflation. I prefer deflation for my currency, I want its value to go
higher and higher, for everyone else, I prefer that theirs go lower and lower, because
it will amplify the amount of trade and creation that those people in that economic
situation create. I think that overall inflation is great because it robs the crap out of
people that don't want to give their money to someone else.

Inflation works like the memory of someone else, where you lend them your
lawnmower, and then you have to borrow your own lawnmower back from them.
That's what inflation is, the world owes you something, because you have the money
that you worked hard for, but as long as you don't claim the favor back, it erodes over
time until you are owed nothing anymore, such as, you can't afford to buy anything
with the money that you saved because of the inflation.

Ego is the power other people have over you. Significance is the power other people
have over you.

How the "isms" and "ity's" affect real world

In an endless sea of perspectives, limited knowledge and limited time to improve,
measure and compare our models of the world, it is best to choose the perspective
which profits you the most. Let me give you an example; I could state two things that
are obviously true, and yet contradictory. Look before you leap, and he who hesitates
is lost. Or, Money is the root of all evil, and he who has the money makes the rules. Or,
The early bird catches the worm and some euphemism about patience. Perhaps Carpe
diem and Don't count your chickens until they've hatched. How about Don't put all
your eggs in one basket, vs put all your eggs in one basket and watch it very carefully.

Cold reading - Silly beliefs

Horoscopes - perhaps explain that the zodiac and the concept of a horoscope dividing
everyone on earth into 12 groups and then giving them some vague crap predictions
about their futures is pretty stupid. Do you really think that if such predications were
true, that all of mankind could be divided into 12? And why can't you ask for better
details? Why isn't anyone named specifically like, XYZ dude is going to shoot up a
school today.



Superstition

It's funny how superstitious we are, with chain letters, post in this thread or you mom
will die in her sleep tonight, step on a crack break your mommas back, and those
obviously false little hints surely do inspire action.

What are the odds?

Hitchens and Dawkins appear to be impressed by the argument that the odds are so
against us existing, that it seems the game is rigged for us to exist ( https://youtu.be/P-
OcOJC27iQ?t=lQ75) I think this is just confirmation bias, just as any horse picker can
send out 100 pieces of mail choosing a winner, then another 100, then another 100,
and some poor bastard will be the recipient of four picked winners in a row. That's
because the cost of picking a winner at random is about 0. That's why trustable
signaling needs to be costly. Just because the universe tried something 1 zillion times
in a row, and you just happen to have received the letter that was all winners in a row,
doesn't mean it was built for you. Also, how special would you consider the living
beings that dominated this planet for thousands of times longer than you? (dinosaurs)
and how did that work out for them?

Destiny / fate / predetermination

Don't find meaning behinds things where there aren't any

You can find meaning and reason behind all things, whether they are there or
not

Birthday paradox

You're good at thinking stuff is destiny, but it's really just that you're bad at
knowing what's actually likely and not. Don't think our destiny is just the
misuderstandings you have about probability.

Belief of control & taking responsibility over ones life- (Locus of control)

What I say is if you believe that you don't have much control over your life, you're
fucked, because if you don't have any control, you can't make anything better, and if
you can't make anything better, well, your life sucks. Now what if you had a different
belief? Even a belief that you had to stretch to make fit, a belief that you did control
certain things in your life even if you really didn't, but you could slightly influence
them and you called it control, what kind of effect would that have? I'll give you an
example, let's say you didn't want to get hit by a car, what could you do? You could
not be around cars and live on an island without them, or you could travel at night
when there's not so many cars around, or if you're driving your own car you could
paint it bright yellow or reflective, I could give you a hundred things that you could do
that wouldn't actually cost that much that would greatly reduce the chance that you
were ever in a car accident, and that same type of creativity and responsibility can
apply anywhere in your life. You have a drinking problem? What's the problem?
Alcohol is near your hand, your hand grabs it and puts it in your body, how do we get
the hand further from the alcohol? You could chop your hands off, or you could go
somewhere where there isn't alcohol, or you could find an empowering meaning that
you felt stronger about through deep soul searching than the reason you are reaching
for the drink. More people in the world need to take responsibility for what's
happening to them in their own lives, now where wouldn't that apply? Responsibility
is fucking massive, so if you want to live longer, then maybe watching the Discovery
channel is not enough, maybe being part of what the Discovery channel is covering it
better, and is that not an option? Can you not invest in one of the stocks, can you not




put 5% of your money into one of these companies who could save your life? That
responsibility is a very strong part of the argument.


Tony Robbins' limiting beliefs, if you don't think you have any, you just found your first one.

Behaviors, Identity, Patterns

Electric cars, excellence, habits, meditation?

The risk-to-reward ratio of electric cars gets crappier and crappier for any kind of
improvements in life the better you are doing, because by definition doing better in
life means that you have already obtained more of the set of the good stuff, which is a
finite set, whereas you have had the minimum of the bad stuff in the risk category,
and therefore the farther along you go, the much easier it gets to find things in the
much more under achieve sucky risk set, and the much harder to make gains in the
farther success set. Let's give you some examples. Should you try psychedelic drugs to
become more creative? If you already have a great mind, perhaps you lose your drive,
or have a really bad trip, and you go from a nice productive guy that only wanted to
create cooler and better ideas for the world through a creativity assister, a chemical,
but you end up like the Unabomber instead, really intelligent and dangerous and evil.
Now is that to say it's a common outcome for people that have tripped? Tripped
meaning that a person has had a psychedelic experience. Well, how much do you
want to risk? If you already suck, and are likely to continue to suck, perhaps you have
more to gain by risky changes to brain chemistry, or risky experiences that you may
enlighten the world about. It's probably not the best analogy, perhaps this one is
better, if you're already dating a super model who loves you, is honest and caring, and
can be a great mother, and you love, how much do you gain by trying to upgrade, and
how much do you risk?

I'm pretty sure you can come up with a scenario where you would suggest to someone
that they not fuck up a good thing. I think you will find that the validity of that advice
increases the better the good thing is, and the more likely the fuck up is to occur, or
have more tragic amplitude.

This is why I have no interest in, nor suggest what is so commonly suggested by many
others in regards to sensory deprivation tanks, or gurus, or meditation, or all of the
other rather artsy fartsy new age and rarely effective in isolation behaviors. If you
want trance, and alteration of consciousness, I'd say the least risky way to get there is
dance/chanting/singing for it occupies the mind and feels good. Some young folks like
to combine those things with some pills like MDMA, and claim to have the same near
soulful experiences of those on more psychedelic substances. If meditation was so bad
ass, why are the Tibetan monks not crushing it on the world stage? Most inventions,
best health, best science, most advanced philosophy, fastest rates of progress in
economic, culinary, musical areas? No? They're rather stagnant and getting stomped
by nearly everyone else that doesn't meditate? Well why would I want to adopt and
or maximize what appears to be an ineffective behavior in my life? So that I may trade
real world useful behavior and growth for the illusion of usefulness? Is it better to
trick myself that I'm doing great things, when really I'm sitting uselessly on my ass
leeching the resources and productivity out of the other people in the world that
actually keep me safe, and develop the music and literature I might enjoy, and fix my



teeth when they're rotting out of my head, only to give little to nothing back in
return? Perhaps except for the warning I leave that live truly can be wasted, and this is
one way to do it, and enhance the likelihood that you do it until the day you die,
because you've found a way to like sucking.

If you're not giving back to the world that brought you into it, and gave you roads to
walk on, understandings of the world to learn and benefit from, a nice language to
speak, beautiful art and music to immerse yourself in, and a body not riddled with
bullet holes or under Nazi government control, you are an asshole. Many good men
fought and were tortured and died, so that you could have the rather awesome
quality of life that you get to enjoy today, and for you to shit on their sacrifice and
quite literally throw your life in the garbage and waste it, and give little to nothing
back. To what degree are you doing these people a favor by allowing their suck to go
unnoticed? I don't think you help them or anyone else by speaking well of things that
are sick. I think that improper tolerance or ignorance of the real effects that occur in
this world because the decisions people and religions and belief systems cause to be
executed is the road to damnation. Perhaps the Tibetan pacifist monks actually did do
something to free the world of Nazism and genocide, I would have to say it seems
unlikely they were so useful. If you're looking for people who take more than they
give, and aren't doing what they should or could to make this world a better place,
you really don't need to look far, the jails have tons of them behind their bars, and
perhaps we are all guilty of this impropriety ourselves from time to time. Let's call the
suck what it is, find it and cut it out where reasonable. Some experimentation in the
areas of uselessness is actually useful, however, it should be kept to a minimum for
the likelihood that useless behavior remains useless, is greater than the likelihood that
a great discovery is made.

Behaviors, Robustness, Frameworks, triggers
Frameworks
Honesty

These ideas, these things, these side benefits that come from smoking, you
would only discover them if you know how to ask the right questions. Now, one
framework that I found useful for asking these types of questions is an incorrect
framework which so far other than what I’ve built myself, has been the best
third party framework that I've found to actually analyze a behavior, see what
the side benefits that are useful are and try and replace it with another behavior
that meets those same benefits at a lower cost or at a higher enjoyment level.

Let's compare two frameworks for analyzing human needs. By the way, these
human needs things, one: presuppose that human beings have these needs
which is up for debate. Two: they presuppose that those needs are constant and
not ever changing. There's a whole other lines to the human being which is the
most conscious, rather the most complicated conscious, living, thinking entity
that we're aware of in the universe, to think that such a thing only has in
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, seven or eight however are them are in there. Or,
in Tony Robbins' contrived, human invented, not really well researched
scientifically system of needs.



However, the most superior I found that I didn't create myself. Let's put
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs in regards to analyzing the side benefits of
smoking, or even call them all benefits, there's no reason to call them side. We
only call them side because they're benefits to people that might miss, "Oh, it
feels good." Well, is there anything else it does? You know, scratching your back
feels good too but it appears to be less addictive than smoking so there's
obviously something else going on there.

Here's Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs versus cigarettes. Okay, are cigarettes
food? No. Shelter? Nope. Self-actualization? Maybe you could stretch that one
in there. Love? No. Man, not really getting a lot of useful detail out of applying
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to the behavior of smoking.

What you'll find is you won't get much of a benefit out of applying Maslow's
Hierarchy of Needs to jack shit which is a reason when you're done learning in
school, you never see it again. That stuff is too remedial. If there was huge
swards of people out there who weren't able to self-actualize, weren't able to
find shelter, weren't able to eat then that framework would be much more
useful. However, since you as a person are lucky enough to hear this book or
read this book probably already have shelter and aren't using the book to shield
yourself from the rain, then you need to use the framework that's more
applicable. Maslow's sucks.

So, let's look at Tony Robbins. Tony believes that there's certainty and variety;
significance and connection, and those things are all paradoxical. So, if you
become too significant, people remove connections. If you become too needy,
then people don't think you're important, you lose significance. And the same
goes for certainty and variety. If you do the same thing all the time, then it's
boring because you're not getting variety. If all you ever have is adventure and
craziness, then you can have post-traumatic stress because you don't have
enough certainty. Then he would like to believe that growth and contribution
are the two needs of spirit, and not the four previous needs of the personality
or identity.

Now, it's interesting enough that he's in the business of selling growth and it
would be pretty awesome if people had that as a need. Not only have that as a
need but it was their most fulfilling of needs, and the more time they spent on
growth and contribution, the more fulfilled they would be. Consequently, since
we have finite time, the less time they spent with certainty, significance, variety
and connection. So, I don't agree with his system. I think I have better. His
system still kicks the shit out of Maslow's and is still very useful. Why do I
mention this to you?

You will find frameworks of understanding, categorization and maximization
that allow you to build categories of things and the look through that lens at
something. Some of those frameworks are useful, some of them are not. If you
have an infrared camera and you're in the Arctic, and everything is the same
fucking temperature, it’s not that useful. There's nothing to be really looking at.



If you have an infrared camera and you're in a wooded area and there are
animals that are generating heat, then the infrared camera is like kickass, and
that environment is a great lens looks at things through because the animals will
stick out massively. I don't think an infrared camera works that well under water
because I don't think that you can sense another animal's temperature through
that medium. I might be wrong XX it would be interesting to see.

What you discover is just like animals can hear at different frequencies, see at
different frequencies, some can see polarization, human beings can't. Some
animals can see into the infrared, human beings can't. Actually with surgery you
might be able to but currently and you probably wouldn't want to anyway, long
story. XX check the optics on infrared. If you look out into space infrared is really
useful, if you're looking at whether people have viruses and their immune
systems is responding with a fever and you want to quarantine them if there's a
swine flu epidemic, it's really cool to have an infrared thermometer that you can
just point at someone's mouth without having physical contact with them and
having to make a new non virus carrying thing that you can out in other people's
mouths then infrared is awesome.

However, if you're a normal human being and not really so concerned with the
temperature of everything around you, you just care about friend or foe; edible
not edible, shit like that, maybe it's more useful you can't see infrared. So,
what's my point?

My point is, organizing the world and looking through that lens of organization
has a massive effect in your ability to act. The frames and lenses which you use
to see the world directly affect the number of behaviors that are presented for
you for action.

If you're a musician and any new thing that happens to you, happens through
the lens of timing, amplitude and timber, then you're going to be accumulating
excellence in that area which you might be able to execute in the future. If
you're constantly focused on the way things sound and you're listening as hard
as you can with your eyes closed, you're going to be missing out on much of the
visual world. Therefore, you're likely to be a shittier artist because you're less
good at color because you're more focused on audio. Perhaps this is the reason
that most musicians aren't great painters. Perhaps this is the reason that most
great book writers aren't great painters or great musicians.

To be a polymath and amazing at more than one thing is pretty hard to do. It
really takes all of your consciousness and all of your focus on a single thing. To
become amazing at it? Well. You don't get to do two things great, you only get
to do one thing great. Thus, you must choose very carefully the lenses you use
to see the reality, the frameworks, shortcuts, prejudices and pigeon holing of
people and categorizing of people. All of those things that you use to
understand the world that you live in... And it's more than understand it. If your
eyes see a thing, then you start to assign meanings and beliefs about the thing.

In this world, you actually don't get to control, what your eyes even see.



And so, you not only have the filter of belief and the filter of meaning, but you
also have the choice as to what even gets put into that filtering system. Thus,
choose the most powerful and useful, and hopefully proven to be useful for
others, belief systems, values, meanings, shortcuts of categorization, shortcuts
of prejudice, shortcuts of / want to be good at these things and not these things.
Those things will make huge impacts and differences in your life, and since we
don't exist in a vacuum and much of our consciousness is affected by our family,
our friends and who we spend time with, when you hear things like the amount
of money you make is the average of your four best friends, some people say
ten, why is that? Because those are the people that are going to affect what you
focus on, what you do and what you see as actionable behavior based on the
inputs that you allow into your mind. Whatever allowed them to get the success
they did is likely to rub off on you.

And so, not only are your beliefs, your values and what you focus on an
influencing factor in your life, but so are the people that are nearest to you
because they will trigger you in ways that...I must say, I don't agree with. If I
spend time with friends that are rather free flowing with the new things, they
want to tell me about and the new things they want to believe. The more
hippiesh, the less specific and less scientific they are about it, their one hour of /
saw this on cable and it was interesting, turns into 12 hours of me disproving it.
An asymmetrical relationship which I guess is a little bit okay for an author, but
unless you're harnessing that energy to benefit the world somewhere else, boy
you can be wasting a lot of time.

You could say Tony Robbins' "Six Human Needs" psychology is much more
useful than any other psychology I've seen for needs, but it's very wishful. For
instance, certainty and variety could also be called fear and greed, because
variety just means do different from what you're currently doing, which is
greed, and then only do the same thing that you're doing is fear. Another thing
to say is that those two definitions are so vague as to apply to all behaviors,
which is basically do the same thing or do a different thing. Now there's a lot of
people that don't really ever do different things, and so the needs of growth and
contribution you could say are very wishful. Now, perhaps he says that growth
and contribution are optional, but those other four - certainty, variety,
significance, and connection - I think he refers to them as the needs of the
identity. I think he also states that one of the most important needs that you
have is to remain consistent with what you think your identity is, which is
interesting, because I guess that would have to be called, yet again, certainty.
However, it really seems like a cop-out because any complex system,
particularly a human being, probably has a lot more than four inputs and
weightings that it's using to measure and what it does. To tell you the truth, I
mean that's what feelings and emotions are. If you were going to say that
human beings had needs, which I believe is a misnomer, I don't even think we
have needs. We just have behaviors.



Side benefits

Let's say you want to change your behavior. Behaviors have side benefits. There
was a study done on people that a said that they had cancer even though they
really didn't, and they tried to figure out why someone would lie about
something that is so important. What they discovered was that part of the
reason someone would lie about having cancer when they didn't have it was
because it was the only time that their family called; and it was the only time
that they felt important; and it was the only time that they felt part of their
family's lives. So, that problem, the terrible problem, they had to will into
seeming to exist in the real world because it paid in real world benefits. Same
with smoking, smoking pays real world benefits. It gives you an excuse to stop
doing something that sucks. It gives you an excuse to go out with people and
talk to them when you may otherwise feel uncomfortable by not having a
common activity to perform with them. It gives you the ability to perform a
ritual which makes you look cool to other people and allow you to feel cool
through having this ritual and good marketing on the behalf of the tobacco
companies to make it look cool so that you can be associated with the Marlboro
man; a tough and rugged mad who needs nothing, who's very useful and
powerful and confident.

Robustness

You can't enforce optimal charitable choices amongst all the citizenry. Humans
are built to be robust, and robustness requires that we all have slight
differences in desires and efficacy so that we can find optimal paths, or create
them where they are or can be made. If everyone felt the same way about
everything, it would leave us open to more risk and less excellence. Living things
have mutations to find excellence, we have experimentation, and we all have
chance and luck.

If you're curious, the relationships that you should have with behaviors that
make you feel different, whether that's singing songs you like or reading cool
interesting facts and news or being around people that respect you and make
you feel good, you should really take a look at how your body and your
psychology respond to increasing dosages of those things to increasing
frequency. You might find that there's a minimum effective dose. For friendship,
there might be a minimum effective dose for singing. Then, as you go over that
minimum effective dose, you get diminishing returns and as you go over
diminishing returns, you get negative. Now your voice doesn't work anymore
because you sang too loud for too long. Now your friends are bored of you
because you are around them too long.

What's the point that I'm saying? In life, your body is a self-correcting, self¬
regulating, basically conscious actor. I mean, I'm stretching the use the word
conscious but it has its own agenda, whether it's conscious of it or not, and it
wants you to do things a certain way. When you decide that you're going to
fight about an issue, like Hey! Body I want you to have less body fat. I want you
to feel high. I want you to feel connected to the world and have trails that you
see and I want your heart rate to be really fast and like feel feelings of euphoria
ecstasy. When you want those things from your body, your body doesn't want



those things. Your body will respond to those chemicals that it doesn't want
there by locking up the receptor that they're trying to access with other things,
or by becoming tolerant, not through some type of balancing behavior of its
own, but through just some other mechanism.

Maybe your body doesn't need to fight against what you're doing because some
other thing fights against what you're doing anyway. Like light, if you look at
bright light, if you look out your window and it's bright out there and then you
look back inside, it takes time for your eyes to readjust to that other level of
light. Now is that a side effect of your body trying to do a specific thing? In this
case, your body is trying to help you have a better view of the world so your
body's doing its best to help you. But it's the reality that's holding you back, it's
the reality of the mechanical biological framework of how your eyes operate,
that they just can't see that much dynamic range of seeing that brightness
without having to lock your iris closed and seeing that darkness without having
to open your iris up.

Even in places where your body's doing its best to help you get what you want
instead of not, you have to account for the fact that a behavior is going to
change over time. The response that you get is going to change over time, and
there should be a minimum effective dose. There should be diminishing returns
and overdoing it. If you're not aware of those three data points, then it's going
to be very hard for you to have a relationship with any behavior, whether that's
gambling or gaming or singing. You need to know the min, the max the normal.

What would you do if you wanted to create an Elon Musk 20 years before he
was born? How would that occur? It would be very useful to have a great school
for him to be able to attend. Apparently it would be very useful to have some
interesting science fiction for him to read and enjoy and then later on in life, I
guess, the existence of a massively profitable IPO and public company exits
along with capitalism would allow such a man to execute his dreams without
the assistance of the government in some cases and with a short period of
assistance from the government in other cases. If I were to ask you 20 years
before he was born, the best way to create him, would science fiction have
made into your answer? And would venture capital have made it into your
answer? Is it likely that the next Elon Musk that gets created 20 years from now,
influenced by the same exact set of things or will something occur in between
now and 20 years from now when said person is identified through his success
to be what it is to that you wanted to create and is he the right framework? Are
there other people that have arrived at excellent behavior and outcomes
through separate inputs? Further still, can great outcomes be had without the
hero worship and cultive personality that follows a single man or is that one
man gets so much shit done actually the way progress happens in this world?

The person you wish you were

Know thyself and thy potential

There's two things that aren't fair; one is that you are too cowardly to
admit how truly great any human being's potential can truly be, and that
any one of us with enough dedication and drive could truly impact



millions of people's lives, both today and in the future, through creation,
film book, music, the spreading of a unique idea, there's so many ways
that we can affect those near us and in perpetuity into the future, and it's
unfair to not be aware of that. There is another side of the coin. It's also
unfair to focus on something that is so hard, nearly unobtainable for much
of the world, and to feel bad if you don't obtain that. There is an art and a
magic to knowing what you are capable of, and what is reasonable or
even unreasonable, but worth trying to do, and still feel good failing,
because you are going to fail a lot on the way there. In explanation, there
is what you can and can't do, and there is what you think you can and
can't do. It would be a miracle if you were completely correct in knowing
what you could or couldn't do, thus we must all take calculated risks, and
reach as far as our arms will let us, to see what we might grasp. We can
stand on the shoulders of friends and the great men that came before us,
and reach higher than we ever thought possible. Shakespeare had a nice
turn of words when he said Do not find yourself, create yourself.

Recently Silicon Valley is about getting rich giving people what they want or
could be addicted to instead of what they should want. Sadly, the battle to
better the common man is costly, and where should the money come from to
do it? Ideally, businesses could find a way to empower people for profit rather
than weaken people for profit. The mindless numbing of our future generations
is truly a tragedy.

When you listen to music, to some degree that's what you're doing. You are
executing someone else's software for you. When you watch a movie, you are
executing someone else's software for you. You hope they have positive
intentions for you, you hope that they want you to have positive experiences,
because we have good peer review they usually do, warn me if this sucks and I'll
avoid it shit. Oh, you watched it and it sucked? Thanks for saving my time. But in
the end, you're living someone else's life. You're living what they gave you.
Maybe it's a wonderful gift, or maybe at some point, you've run out of time
now. I hope you've enjoyed the ride, but no one else will get to enjoy your ride
now. You had a chance to build a nice ride for the rest of the world to make the
world a better place, to give back to the people that gave to you. You had that
chance, and instead you just took and never gave. You ate up the music, you ate
up the language you ate up the education, you ate up the recipes, you ate it all
up, and then you took it with you when you died. You didn't give anything back.
If you don't show people the scummery of their ways, and there is profit in
them executing those ways, they will fucking run those programs. If people see
profit in being pieces of shit, they will do it. It's my job to show them a better
fucking way. Stop living everyone else's program for you. Build your own
program. Stop absorbing everyone else's content to the exclusion and deletion
of yourself. Have balance - give and take. Absorb. Build. Mix. Extend. Expand.
Give back


To be, or not to be, that is the question—
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer



The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,

Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,

And by opposing, end them? To die, to sleep—

I don't care what you are trying to do that is going to make a big impact
on the world, you are going to be faced with challenges, you are going to
need to have internal drive and self-reliance, or an exceptionally helpful
peer group that can help you get to that level. My father, I wished that he
had a made a larger impact on the world, I wish he was the descendant of
some type of royalty, noble upbringing or lineage, I'm not, my father is a
hard-working, loving, caring, honest man who has worked hard every day
of his entire life, I really mean every single day, I wouldn't want to rob him
of the potential to do something even more amazing with his life, by just
not thinking enough of him to even think it possible, nor do I want him to
feel even the slightest bit of sadness for choosing to lead an honest
hardworking life.

As you grow up, you have so much that you want. You want your freedom, you
are tired of so many people having so much power over you. Due to the luck of
the draw, some of you will have great parents, some not so great, and some
none at all. Some of you will get great advice, some terrible, and some only
silence. GREAT NEWS! You are about to get some life changing advice.

The duality of death. Some people have the courage to face death and fight for
their country, perform other courageous acts, whereas some of other people,
they need the courage to face life, and instead are cowards and choose death.
It's an odd duality that in one case the courageous person dies and in one case
the courageous person lives, and they feel this much the same with what we are












faced with now. The courage to discover the world that is inevitable, that is
obvious, that will happen regardless of whether we want it to or not, where we
live longer as we nearly always have. In this case, death is a courageous action,
and in this case, the cowardice and the cowardly action is the one where we
choose death; for in our needlessly early and needlessly painful death that
comes as a result of not putting up a fight and pretending that these things
aren't going to happen and that nothing can't be done about them. That
pretending is cowardice.

If you think the lives of yourself and the people like yourself are worth more, do
these things instead:

Being a man or a woman is a unique experience and your life and thoughts are
likely to not be exactly like anyone else that has ever existed. Because of that, it
would be quite silly to waste time writing a book that everyone was supposed to
read the same way. Some people, perhaps you, will benefit from reading some
parts of this book more than others. Perhaps the order you eat this information
in improves digestion based on your unique perspective and life experience.

Do people consider you more of A. Hippie B. Entrepreneur C. Artist D. Scientist?
Xx I wonder if there's a way to get these self-identifications down to a
management and non-insulting number. Perhaps the two major themes are
feelings vs reason. Arts is feelings and science is reason? I know there are other
giant ones in here, like religious vs non-religious, rich vs poor, tit for tat vs tit for
2 tats. Political orientation, gender... So many variables! Perhaps this is why
books are rarely written from a race, gender perspective? Maybe the authors
just weren't flexible enough. If it is the case that this type of unique
specialization in framing similar concepts is possible, which I'm fuckin sure it is,
then it should be demonstrable on a small scale.

Do you believe that you should have the right to have kids? Do you believe it
was a good thing that you were born? Do you believe you have the right to
decide who else is allowed to have kids? Do you believe in the right for an
individual to have a chance at life, perhaps even a chance at a good life?

You would be surprised at the range of opinions here. Hard questions. Is being
overweight dangerous to your health? If your health is impaired, should you
have the right to medical care? Is it reasonable then that those whose lives you
will impact and time you will consume through being sick, have a right to
impose healthy things on you because you will be screwing them over with your
risk taking and or unhealthy eating? Should you have the ability to opt out of
the social safety net, because you're comfortable doing unhealthy and risky
things and didn't ask anyone to take care of you? Should current you be able to
make that decision for future you? Who gets to be the health czar?

If health is such an important part of life, and it can be influenced with science,
why don't we mandate a science production quota, or labor quota, as we do
forcing kids to learn other languages? There is a line that must be drawn
between what it is worth to sacrifice for, and for how much sacrifice.



Here is a gigantic one. How many lives is your life worth? Would you die for your
kids, your parents, how about three random people, three schoolmates? What
about two guys you barely knew? Two girls? Two kids that weren't yours?

What would you answer to this question in public, versus what you would do if
no one ever knew your decision? Sounds like a game of SAW. The answers to
these questions are really, really important, and there are people making
exactly these answers every day, whether they realize it or not.

What research gets funding? Which countries get invaded? Is non-vaccination
punishable by law, how punishable? How far does dragnet surveillance get
taken?


I think I know some of the easier answers for myself. I believe my life is worth
the most, perhaps that will change when I have kids, but for now, I must exist.
Then my loved ones, my woman, then my kin (parents), then people I like, then
people I know, then everyone else. Some people would put animals pretty high
on this list as well. I wouldn't be surprised if many people put animals before
people they would never meet.


Is there an objective method by which you could know which of these personal
beliefs caused the best emergent outcomes for all participants in the system,
perhaps a mixed belief where some had different one at different times would
be best? It seems as though that is how life is designed, you go from power god
to one that the leads and cares, but you can't start there, you have to go
through power god first.

Do you matter?

If it is the case that one percent of the world owns 90 percent of the stuff,
then it's quite likely that that one percent gets to decide what the other
90 percent does with their time, more or less. As such, if you want to
make an impact in the world, then you probably need to start and finish
with the one percent. Now here's an odd fact, if you didn't know it, if you
make over 31k USD per a year, you are in the one percent. How fucked
up is that? I find that knowing what percentage of the planet's wealth is
stored in different owners is probably less valuable than knowing which
small groups in that large group you can successfully influence. Hell, there
are probably some groups in there that will actively try to fuck you up if
they discover that what you are doing might cost them their money.

What kind of person would you like to be?

I think you and your loved one and your friends are worth more than people you
will never meet. I'm not willing to let my family die, or myself die, because
seamen somewhere else is having a bad time. Lucky for us, the rising tide
usually rises all ships. These things we do to help ourselves will almost always
help others, not including some exceptions to that rule like property rights. If
you have the right to kick other people off a piece of land, then you having that
power is nearly exclusive of anyone else having it. In that case, we really do
have a battle of powers.







The illusion of importance

For many successful people, they misattribute, along with many of their peers,
the importance they actually have to the company they founded, or currently
manage. Whether a company is doing good things or not has much more to do
with how you look compared to your peers, in that, if your peers suck, it's very
easy to look like a winner. However, if your peers are ass kicking machines, then
even though ideally you should be happy with your performance, the market
may starve you out of existence. Bill Burr has a pretty funny skit on how he
thought Steve Jobs was a douchebag, and now that he's gone, look how the
company has gone to shit. In reality, it was the hard work of many, many other
people that allowed those things to be created, and if he truly was integral to
the company's wellbeing, should not the company be in dire straits now?

When you could read someone, you want to say a bunch of things to them that
make you sound insightful, as though you are able to identify specific traits in
that person, because you have a greater understanding. That then would give
them credence to believe more of the things that you said. Like good liars mix in
a lot of truth, the maximum amount of truth and the minimum amount of lies,
because if they test you, you pass more of the test because there's more truth
density. Bullshit artists do the same thing when they're bullshitting you. They
tell you as many non-testable good sounding things that they can so that they
can get cool points and pass through more of the bullshit, which doesn't pass
tests.

What are some standardized feel good, complementary, sound smart,
intellectual mumbo jumbo bullshit that you can tell people that they love to
hear? Because people have found profit in believing that they are unique,
special and deserve great resources, particularly more resources than people
that aren't them, that may not be as great, they believe that consciousness is
something that is hard to understand, hard to measure.

Confidence leads to excellence

XX increased behavioral variance and follow through volatility. Mutations that allow
for variation and hence robustness are the result of lacking self-doubt. The more self¬
doubt that you have, the less decisive you are, the longer you remain in a non-
mutated state, and thus the less variation in behavior you will have. Thus, the less like
you are to become an outlier, or have legendary robustness. This is closely related to
analysis paralysis and the opposite of ready-fire-aim.

Fake it ’till you make it

Cocksure and wrong
Old quotes

Mortals and Others (1931-35 )[edjt]

Main article: Mortals and Others
It is generally admitted that most grown-up people, however
regrettably, will try to have a good time.

The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world
the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.



Often paraphrased as "The whole problem with the world is that
fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser
people so full of doubts."

Cf. Russell (1951) New Hopes for a Changing World, "One of the
painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are
stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled
with doubt and indecision."

Cf. also W. B. Yeats (1919), The Second Coming, "The best lack all
conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."

To understand the actual world as it is, not as we should wish it to
be, is the beginning of wisdom.

From < http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bertrand Russell >


Fake it 'till you make it

Stage one confidence through ignorance
Final stage is confidence earned

Endure a little bit of suck to make it from unearned to earned competence
Don't be a scammer

It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and only minutes to ruin it
Most great scammers could have been greater business people instead
You put yourself at odds with the most powerful tool any wealthy person has, the law.
Pay attention to what other people say about your attitude, it's easier for them to see what
you're doing than it is for you, you can't even see your own face

You're too busy doing the feeling to notice that you're doing it. It's funny to watch
people act like they're happy or fulfilled when you can tell they're not. It's like when
your girlfriend tells you nothing's wrong when you ask her what's wrong. Only after
you beg, plead and cry might you find out what indeed was wrong. Most people are
bad actors.


Morals

Trolley problem, Morality, Decision making, Values

The trolley problem is going to actually be executed in cars as decision logic.

Back to the trolley problem, let's say you wanted to use brute forcing and creativity to
create a realistic set of possible factors which you could or should factor into your
decisions regarding the value of human life, the difference between persona action
and inaction, the response of other parties in the future to the survivors of the event,
getting caught or not caught, etc. You'll find that when you make it a specific goal to
achieve, to expand the number of factors that you consider, and the parties to which
those factors could apply. Let's give it a whirl so to speak. Parties, person to be tested,
we'll call this poor bastard the testee.

In my analysis, as in so many other paradoxical questions, it seems as though the truly
useful data is left out of the question. Why should you value all human lives at the
same value, which we already know you do not? This is the reason you don't let
strangers into your home, because they are worth less than family and worth less than
yourself. You'll find that you're last much more likely to allow people into your home
that you would like to make love to, or are friends, or you'd like to be friends, etc.
Thus, it's quite obvious that you have a process by which you are used to deciding






which other people in this world are worthy of sharing what little time, space, or
things you have with. Now, this thought experiment of a trolley I think is a bad
example to start with, because we know much more about trains than trolleys in the
western world, as they're much more common, and faster, and more dangerous, thus
a much better educational tool.

The experiment goes, if a runaway trolley was rushing towards four workmen working
on that track that would be unable to escape, and you could flip the switch causing
the track to switch to a different track where a single worker wouldn't be able to
escape, would you flip the switch? Now what if instead of being at the switch, there
was a fat man on a bridge over the tracks, and you were standing near him, and you
could push this fat man over the side and somehow magically this would prevent the
other four people dying? What a silly idea, fat men nor cows nor cars are known to
make much difference in the speed of an oncoming train whatsoever. Anyway, for the
sake of this poorly designed thought experiment, let’s grant them their assumptions.
Would you push that fat guy?

Here is what I will tell you should go into your considerations. If the fat man's friends
and family detect that you have murdered their fat man, they're going to rightly
punish you, and use the state to punish you for manslaughter. You can't allow the silly
people of this world to kill other people because they thought it was useful for
someone else to do so. If people believed that their estimate of a greater good
allowed people to be murdered, wow, you'd have a whole lot of murdered people. It
turns out that no man knows the future well enough to know that those other people
couldn't have escaped the train, the train wouldn't have been otherwise derailed, the
people you thought you saw were actually dummies and this was a test of some part
of the train and not real lives in danger, or that the impact if unavoidable would be
fatal, perhaps they all might just lose a leg.

Therefore, I see this thought experiment being rather poorly formed for the following
reasons: You must not act, for you operate from incomplete knowledge. You must not
act, for you will personally be punished much more harshly than you will be rewarded.
The four you think you saved won't pay you enough or protect you enough from the
peers of the one that you killed and the state. The fat man wasn't doing something
risky and stupid, he was only crossing a bridge, specifically out of the way of the train,
whereas those other men earned their fates by not respecting the train tracks, as is
required by law and common sense.

If you choose the one over the four, haven't you increased the chance that four more
people will make a life threatening decision by making someone else pay for their
risky behavior? If the reason this is a trolley moving at speed instead of something
slower, is to try to limit your time to think, and get you to be more emotional and less
logical, which I believe it is, it's a great thing that we have books, dreaming and
education so that when these pressing, time sensitive issues arise, we have already
pre-calculated good action and good outcome beforehand.


Other than learning that this is a poorly formed thought experiment, which to my best
guess is supposed to estimate how you as an individual value the weight of one



anonymous person versus four anonymous people, against the idea that you will be
guilty by action for saving four, but killing one, and guilty by inaction by allowing four
to be killed but not killing one. I can only say that it seems quite stupid to combine
someone's valuing of another's fitness in regards to "fat" or non-fat, pretty much
destroys the information you would get regarding the one death through action vs the
four deaths through inaction. Couldn't you just more easily ask, how much less value
do you see in fat people? Should they be punished for their level of fitness? Perhaps if
you didn't believe their answer, you could structure a superior thought exercise to
derive their true feelings on the matter.

In the end, I see very, very little use for this poorly formed thought exercise, it's far
too removed from reality. Really, for any reasonable thinker, the fat man should never
be pushed. You will be guilty of manslaughter, and fat men don’t stop trains, or even
slow them to any useful degree.

In regards to the one versus four, you don’t have the data you'd need to make a good
decision, you don't know they couldn't escape, so you will yell and holler, but you
won’t perform an action that will once again lead to your personal annihilation by the
state for manslaughter. The law and society you live in has a much harsher penalty for
causing harm through action personally, than it does through watching as harm
occurs, but being too much in shock to act. You’ll do much less time in prison by non¬
action.

Now, is it fair to care more about your time in prison, perhaps alive but incarcerated,
than it is for you to care about those lives? Well yes, I must say that it is,

"We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal &
independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable,
among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; -
Declaration of Independence

From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life. Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness >

If you believe the above line to be true, then you should value your own life as at least
equal. You aren't risking your life on the tracks as they are, and you will be harshly
punished for acting. Anyway, poorly designed experiment with some interesting
discovery that the state has already decided the matter for you, and people must pay
personally for the risks they take. Friends and family of deceased will harm you more
than friends and family of survivors, for vengeance has larger amplitude than favor.
Those that will harm you are more dangerous than those that will help you are useful.
The harm hurts more than the help feels good.

I would say that fixing the question, and looking at the system are two important
steps that seem to be left out of all the common teaching of logical thought. It seems
like what's most common is to be more logically effective and tactical about the
wrong questions, and not mindful of the system as a whole. Do not trust the question,
do not trust the data, know your desired outcome in positive terms, know the system.
This is how you get superior answers to those that came before you, because logic on
its own will not tell you to do these things at all. Logic is like a physical calculator; it



only knows what you key into it. Your hammer won't ask you to use a different kind of
nail, nor tell you where to hammer it.

If you want people to do something that isn't done often done, it's really helpful to
give a name to that think you want them to do, and if you can define the term, then it
becomes a memory anchor in their mind, greatly enhancing the presence and
identification and spread of the behavior in the wild. I think words need to exist to
quickly describe the specific pre-work that needs to be done before using the hammer
of logic. I also want a word for the specific action of knowing which tool to use for a
thing. Very specifically not requiring you need to know how to use it, but that it exists
and this is where it should be used.

Tool sense or tool awareness. Every other important domain of knowledge has a title.
The concept that problem solving as a domain or tool use as a domain doesn't have a
title is stupid. Thus, know which tool is right for the job in your domain, shall be called
tool sense. Even if you don't know how to use the tool, you know it exists, what it's
good for, why it should it be used here, and therefore can find someone to use it. I
should coin a term for the meta layer of knowing when to use a tool, what is the
lawyer before the tool? What would I search for to discover if such a word may
already exist, and even if it does, I guess that if it were good, it would be known,
therefore likely not good and therefore likely needing made new. What should I call
this scope expansion step? System/brute forcing (finding max qty of) parties and
variables in the system/brute forcing (finding max qty of) states or actions of the
parties.

Then creating the table of all possible outcomes combining all the measure outcomes
when all parties have all the states and all the actions they can perform in different
orders and combinations and locations, etc., to create a giant hard to understand
mass of outcomes from which you may filter those that are most desired. Creating
that table is how you beat lots of puzzles and logic questions and don't miss non
obvious answers because you can't miss an answer, because you have the largest
possible set to choose from.

Imagine you wanted to create a beautiful sculpture from a block of marble, if you start
out with a small block, you get only a small sculpture where the detail is hard to see,
and you don't have the space you need to execute your vision. If you choose a larger
block of marble, you will end up with the fine details that people will enjoy with their
naked eyes in person. If you start with a mountain, you may get mount Rushmore. The
point is, the smaller and less stuff you have to work with to create an idea, the less
resistant to the elements, and impressive your sculpture will be. Expanding your set of
variables and possibilities and externalities accounted for in the work you do to find all
the answers and outcomes possible to a situation is your block of marble.

Similarly, while you will have a more lasting and impactful creation, just like a large
sculpture, it will take you longer to create. Good, fast, cheap, you can have any two of
the three. In statistics they call this the probability space



Logic is a tool, and knowing when, where, and with what inputs towards what end is
outside its ability.


Fuck their question. Make a better question.

If your first inclination upon hearing this trolley problem isn't to attempt to ascertain
more relevant data about the parties involved, than you will be more unaware of the
factors that you should be including in your analysis, for instance, if you believe that
people should take responsibility for their own actions, and those people on the tracks
chose to stand in that dangerous place.

So the point is that, you know you do believe in responsibility, and you know this
would be a place where that belief should be used, however you never notice that
responsibility is part of the equation, because you're so focused on the restrictions of
the problem, and your role in it, that you never get to thinking about what these
people deserve outside the system of you and the train and your decisions, but what
they have earned in the system that isn't mentioned, which is the system of
"deserving" and responsibility.

Thus due to the very, very wide range of things that can and are push and pull, give
and take, earn and not earn, fair and not fair in this world, I believe it's entirely
required that you take a moment to be mindful of all the surrounding, related,
touching things that are tangential to what you're thinking about, without actually
being the thing you're thinking about. This idea of mindfulness and holistic thought
and being at least 1 extra level higher up and looking down on a wider problem where
the original parts become smaller parts of a larger functioning system is how you
make breakthroughs and discoveries that everyone else misses. Elon Musk calls this
thinking from first principles.

I believe Sherlock Holmes likely called it "It's elementary my dear Watson, anyway, the
summary is, if you ignore all the other parts that touch and influence and are near a
thing, you'll rarely make a better decision about the thing. That's the kind of limiting
logic that sees you remove one dictator and see 2 worse ones replace him, or you stop
doing one bad habit, and instead do another bad habit, which might have even been
worse than the first. Nature abhors a vacuum. Oddly enough think why this specific
phrase might exist "power vacuum." If you see the whole system from 1 level higher,
you learn the superior strategy of fulfilling the needs of the world under pressure, but
choosing the thing that will fill the vacuum strategically, before you tacitly create the
vacuum and think your job's complete, only to have to come back to the issue once
you've admitted your first attempt at fixing it was actually a failure, and hopefully this
time doing the thing that is strategically correct and choosing the thing you want, not
just excising the thing you know you don't want.

In all matters where time to think exists, see the system around the thing, choose
what you want, be strategic not merely tactical, and you can solve a problem the first
time.



Yes, so this is very important, when tony doesn't completely agree with you off the
bat, and has doubts, you need to know about that shit, because you didn't do a good
enough job, and you need to test that on other people to see their reactions the
same! Let's handle the objections before they occur outside the book!

Need to speak to how you know when you're not going to grow any bigger and you
need to move on to the next thing probably need to handle the issue regarding people
that are already successful and wealthy not needing to downgrade into retail. Well, I
suggest you use your newfound wealth to play in the biotech space, you might save
your own life.

Sensitivity

Empathy

Empathy is often the privilege of the powerless. "Patience is a minor form of despair
disguised as a virtue." - Ambrose Bierce. The rage you feel when things aren't doing
what you want them to do is useful for humans, and animals, it's not useful for
machines, not at all. And it hurts you.


Your Internal Environment

Pain and pleasure programming

Ever wonder why your balls are barely there, until you hit them, and then the world
has changed for the worse. It's because if your balls get taken out, you're out of the
gene pool. So the amount of pain we feel is often related to how useful a thing is for
our procreation, more than our survival. It's the survival of our unborn.


Fighting

168.1 actually really want to put that in environment. And the reason that I want to
put internal environment, by the way, this I got from my martial arts instructor. It's
funny that I do remember the origin of a lot of the ideas that I've gotten. Maybe it's
because I've got so few from some places, so they're really unique when I get them.
So I went to the Warrior and Scholar Kenpo Karate School, and you know they would
say some cool and smart shit like you know, "The dragon needs to, the tiger needs tc
constantly prove itself, so it's always fighting and testing itself. But the dragon alread\
knows that it would have won, so it doesn't need to fight." That was a cool saying.
There's shit that you can take away from that, it's quiet useful. You can avoid a lot of
conflict by assuming the win and you know, whenever there's conflict, even when yoi
/in, your fucking hands are going to hurt, a lot and your clothes are going to get


fucked up, might be some police, might be some lawyers' fees. The fights you win, you
Jon't really win. You still lose. You win more of the fight that you win, you lose less the
fight you win, but you still lose. And if you don't believe that, get in ten fights in a row
and then see how you feel. Believe me, you'll feel fucked up because you'll be fucked
up. Or you're in one of those experiments with you rather fight forty horse sized
ducks, or one duck sized horse. Or the other way around. So


Patience

Patience is a minor form of despair disguised as a virtue is from and often said by one
eyed Don.

Tit for tat, good for people, bad for machines

The rage you feel when things aren't doing what you want them to do is useful for
humans, and animals, it's not useful for machines, not at all. And it hurts you.

Let's say that you default and execute a good tit for tat strategy, and someone makes
you wait, or doesn't do what they said they would do, now you feel that you have to
punish that behavior. Yep, here’s the shitty part. You start executing the punishment,
and having a shitty personal state yourself long before that fucker is ever there to
notice at all. And thus you have destroyed your own state of mind, and your own well¬
being, in order to execute a useful tit for tat revenge strategy, and in the end all you
have done is fuck yourself over.

Let’s say the person you are interacting with is a real piece of shit, the kind of piece of
shit that shuts down the moment you try to show them the error of their ways, now in
the end all you have done is fuck your emotions and your quality of life over, for a
piece of shit that tit for tat doesn't even fucking work on, because as already stated,
they are a piece of shit, they feel no remorse, they have no empathy, and they're not
interested enough in being excellent to give a shit about your relationship, so they'll
just fail out as soon as you raise your expectations and move on to their next victim.

The low hanging fruit is to learn to not treat machines like people, for they truly
genuinely don't' give a single fuck about your rage, and will not modify their behavior
to avoid it. They are not conscious actors, and thank goodness, because if they were
judgmental, imagine how they'd treat you based on your internet search history.

Soul

Soul in and only in the brain

How can damage to the brain be consistent in its effect by location of injury, yet
in death, if you kill it all, somehow, you're cool, and you just transport to an
afterlife?

After sleep, like an afterlife

You're obviously too important to not be alive and active and conscious when
you're sleeping, so every night when you go to sleep, there's another you that
appears in heaven, and every time you does off, another copy of you gets
issued. Just as there's no afterworld for your sleeping self, there is no afterworld
for your dead self. There is only one you, and it's here, or nowhere.

Soul shit

If everything that makes you what you think you are, your behaviors, your
feelings, your thoughts, your abilities, can be edited by Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation, or lobotomy, how likely is it that you will survive the complete
destruction of your brain. It's funny that we think that we have bodies, when in
reality, we are bodies. I learned a lot about true nature of the soul and
personality when my mother got schizophrenia

Your soul

Is the likelihood that you peform a certain set of behaviors. If what you are
likely to do changes, your identity, and thuse your vary sould changes. For what
is a man except his thoughts and actions? Your identitiy and "soul" is nothing



more than the likelihood that you think and do certain things in the present and
future.

Well that's interesting, what about the permanance? What about that
everlasting, undying "thing" which isn't "meat" and isn't "your mind, or body"
that other third thing? Well, that you see, is a fancy fantasy that makes you feel
special, and allows you to do better in the world. Those people that think they
don't have a soul, they have a harder time of it. It can be harder for them to
find happiness, and harder for them to find meaning, because there's this gap in
understanding.


Pride

The staircase, the ratchet, you
Winning can feel like losing

The curse of winning an auction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s curse
You won, yay! But now no one will pay more than you did, because
they would have, when you won. So you basically just made sure
that tin the short term, barring an auction house that has bad
marketing for bidders, you're fucked. Due to the ratcheting effect,
the constant pressure of us to get bored, and want more, this
means that you've gotten your raise, you can't get another raise,
because you've maxed them out, so by winning, you feel loss.

Power of Groups

Xx (replace religions with groups, let them make the analogy on their own)
Religion as a costly signall edit l



Costly religious rituals such as male circumcision, food and water deprivation,


and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious


beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear


maladaptive.® Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup
cooperation.™ Cooperation leads to altruistic behavior,™ and costly signaling


could explain this.™ All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals,










performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious groups In this
way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signaling their
investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among
humans, the threat of free riders grows.® Costly signaling theory accounts
for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter
free riders.®

Irons proposed that costly signaling theory could explain costly religious
behavior. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and
solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He
showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of
northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These "ostentatious"
displays signaled commitment to Islam to strangers and group
members.® Sosis demonstrated that people in religious communities are
four times more likely to live longer than their secular counterparts,®® and
that these longer lifespans were positively correlated with the number of
costly requirements demanded from religious community
members.® However, confounding variables may not have been
excluded.® lannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious
communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church
increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased
proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church
that has more stringent demands on its members.®

Despite the experimental support for this hypothesis, it remains
controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as
simply by attending a religious service.® However, the hypothesis predicts
that people are more likely to join and contribute to a religious group when
its rituals are costly.® Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There
is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of
commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits.® However, the
reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and
punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for
increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for
increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation.® However, Sosis
argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved
health, assistance during crises, and greater psychological well being.is

Appreciation

We live in magical times

Imagine a time in the not so distant past where there was no GPS navigation, no
cell phones, no beepers, no internet, hell, lets imagine no television or radio
even. When you went to a place, that place was all you saw. There was no easy
window to other realities. It was you, your surrounds and your imagination.
Maybe you had the stories told by those around you, maybe you had your
imagination. That's it. What a magical and different world we have today. The
ability to fly to a faraway land for the price of a night in a hotel. We truly live in
magical times.

The Anology for Sucking it up for the time being Before you do the fun Stuff

218. Nearly all of the great comedians and productive people that you find in the
world that weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths, and even some that were,


like the Dreyfus off of Seinfeld, had crappy jobs that were dead end, meaningless,


dock worker, crappy, retail, you're not going anywhere cool jobs. And they fought and
saved and studied their way into greatness, which means that you will need to fight
and study your way into greatness by saving and building an intellect that has the
traits that other people care about and are willing to pay for it. Now, an easy way to
analogize that is that as human beings, we all have to, uh, you know, suck somebody's
tit before we're old enough to chew. And nobody likes it, and nobody brags about it
later in life, but at some point, we were all sucking on mommy or dying. (This goes
here because its related to the above recording- Tony)


Programmed for laziness & Internal Conflict/Lobbying


383.So, we're talking about personal development and lobbying for what you want in


the world and then internal lobbying you do with yourself by creating things that
you'll actually do instead of the imaginary, "These are all the things that I would do if I
had the balls to actually do everything that I said." You could call it infinite discipline
perhaps. Would require infinite time but maybe you're not that creative maybe
everything you'd ever want to do personally doesn't take that much time because you
have a small standard for what must exist in your life.

So, there's a set of things that you would tell yourself to do if you had infinite
willpower to do everything, right? Do a set of max bench, fuck it. You know what, we'll
just do a set of max on every muscle every other day and then we'll split it ad maybe
split it in three push- and pull-ups whatever. And, we'll only eat food that's flavorless
but has maximum health benefits; omega 3s, proteins and very little refined sugars,
very little refined anything. Then we'll get the proper perfect dose of vitamin D. We'll
get on down the list, all the perfect things. I'll call my mom this many times a year. I'll
fucking volunteer this many times a year, etc., etc. At some point you discover you're


not doing most of this shit, right? Why? Because laziness exists. You're programmed


for laziness. Laziness is paid off, great dividends and using less calories for hundreds of
thousands of years and so you're going to do fucking laziness, right? So, what do we
do? We start knocking things off that set that you want to do but you know you're not
actually going to do.


Then, you get to level three which is, which of the things can you keep doing? So, you
went to the gym twice and then you stopped, who gives a fuck? Oh, you went and

































learned 10 new words of a new language and then you stopped, no one gives a shit.

No one cares. And then, there are things that are even worse; there are things you can
learn a little bit and you think that you actually know what you're talking about but
you fucking don't maybe it's drug use, maybe it's a firearms without enough safety,
maybe its driving like a race car driver, you think you're good at it but now you're
dead wrapped and around a pole or you're worse someone else's family.


So, what am I telling you? I'm telling you that there's an internal conflict inside
/ourself which is: the set of shit you would do ideally; the set of shit you'll actually do;
then the smaller sub set of shit that you'll actually do over a long enough period of


time to get the benefits you want; and then we got another smaller set called shit you
convinced other people to do and then that set gets run through the same shit that


yours just did because all you did was add to their big list and then it gets to their
smaller list and then it gets to their smaller list. And so, the actual amount of shit you
can convince people to do for a long enough period of time in their own fucking life to
improve their life is super small and probably an order of magnitude smaller than
what you can do for yourself. So, if you broke your dick and broke your fucking brain
to get something into your own psychology and program it and do it long enough for it
to become a habit and get it to stay.


The hard life of doing the right thing

It’s pretty emotionally shocking when your good reasoning keeps making you need to
be a hard-ass and not do things you enjoy. It’s a good thing we learn to love what
we’re good at, and the respect that comes with it.

Cooperating with yourself to get shit done is the smallest version of collectivism

40. Collectivism works great and the smallest unit of collectivism isn't a pair of people
working together like friends, it's actually getting yourself to do work that you should
do. Because this internal struggle between what you should do what you can do and
what you actually do is a form of cooperation internal to yourself, so there should be a
special .5 half a human extra unit of cooperation that can occur internally.

Settling

If you settle for the stuff that is just ok, you don’t leave room for the really good stuff.
Low expectations are the father of regret
Barely existing - Spirit

I think most people live in a gray middle of little shame and little honor, and little
based. That’s why "based" is now a compliment, a world of people barely hear.


Desire

Dream high

Even the best of us could be doing better

Tony Robbins is the most successful success coach in the world
He could be creating copies of himself
He could have a curriculum in schools



















He could be giving away his seminars for free instead of giving away food
for free

He could be having a lasting and meaning impact on the world in the same
scale that capitalism, Marxism, communism, religion, libertarianism,
republicanism, socialism, being a democrat, etc. However, he is not.

Why doesn't he have much YouTube following, why doesn't he have a
podcast, why doesn't he have a radio show, why doesn't he have better
quotes, why hasn't his material improved in 15 years?

Well, I would be guessing, but
Maybe

He doesn't want to

Risk the money?

He's run out of steam

He was a better organizer and presenter of others ideas but ran out of
steam when he stopped absorbing from others.

His height has left him starved for oxygen over time, and its affected his
creative, homeboy is tall as fuck, 6 foot 7.

Sex, money, power or perhaps happiness?

If you interview old people or middle-aged people about what advice they have for
you when you're younger, the number of older men that will tell you to have as much
sex as you can with as many young girls as you can is fucking high, really high, which
makes you wonder what really is important in life.

Careers giving people what they desire is horrible

Imagine the only thing in this world is you, and your house. You could either paint
your house today, or you could build a chair. If you choose to paint your house, it will
end up painted. If you choose to build a chair, you will end up with a chair. That's it
folks, that's the entire magic of careers. You will cause in the world what you choose
to cause. This is where we are with most of the young smart folks of the world
working on the next best rate my sandwich app. People work for money, money is
exchanged for what people want, and what people want usually is retarded. Thus,
what people do with their time is also retarded, as an effect of the first cause of
humans having really stupid desires.

If you are giving people what they want, you're very likely to be harming them,
because what people want is quite often not what they should want.


Create Yourself

You can't be a great leader unless you learn to lead yourself first

Men are somewhat instinctive in noticing weak people. They don't like following weak
people for the most part. A weak leader likely is no leader at all.

The best

"The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity" - Yates
Get addicted to winning

Winning is a journey, not a destination



You ever wonder why some people do easily what you might find so hard to do?
How did they get there? Was it an accident of chance? Did the perform some
rite of passage that gave them live long access, seemingly effortlessly, to that
which you have been unable to find your way to?

How can some people be so productive, and so happy and so loved by many?

I will tell you, it's not magic. If you look into the histories of most of the most
respected and influential people through history and today, you will find a
common theme.

Think about the hours they put in. How many hours did they spend,
unrewarded, made fun of, broke, living in a van?

Feel the win now

Feel the future, get some easy wins. Like speed wins.

One trick you can use to shift the reward of what you are doing close
enough to the present for you to enjoy doing it, and feel rewarded
working on it, is to see how fast you can do it. And if it's something
repetitive, you can see if you can beat your old time. This likely will
restrict your creativity. This can be a good thing if what you are doing is
repetitive enough, and lets be serious, much of what we need to do in life,
we're putting 0 minutes into.

Feel the future. If you're doing something great that leads in a great
direction, dream a little in that direction. Take some of that future joy and
bring it back into the present with yourself. Knowing the true value and
joy at the end of the path will make you want to travel truer and faster
down that path.

The first minute of progress is the most important, for it is the minute that
makes all the minutes that come after it possible. An object in motion
tends to stay in motion. Get that first minute! Eat the frog!

So any minutes of nearly any quality will be more likely to get you
into hobbying and then enjoying, and then having as a habit what
you need to be doing.

Feel the future

If you're doing something great that leads in a great direction, dream a little in that
direction, take some of that future joy and bring it back into the present with yourself.
Knowing the true value and joy at the end of the path will make you want to travel
truer and faster down that path.

Freedom to fuck up

More success more freedom. Easier to fuckup. You have no boss. And your old state
that allowed success is not similar to the new successful state. You might start to
believe your own bullshit.

Permission to fuck up

A life of success is a life of failure. The more opportunities to do good you have and try
and experiment the more you will fuck up. If you don't want to fuck up kill yourself
you'll never fuck up again. A life of success is a life of failure. The more opportunities
to do good you have and try and experiment the more you will fuck up. If you don't
want to fuck up kill yourself. You'll never fuck up again.



R717

Don't make problems, you don't need

I got this from an interview with, Quentin Tarantino, and he said he got it from Harvey
Keitel (was an interview with Ridley Scott, and Quentin and lots of other amazing
directors on The Hollywood insider) Like a good director, don't ruin someone's
performance acting out a part for you that they have had to think about and work on,
see what they have to show you, and redirect them as you wish. I feel the same way
about directing people's decisions in regards to their choice of career and education.
It's great to see where they are at, and try to figure out their motivation and needs
that they are trying to meet with their decision. I think that you'll find you agree with
several bad ass paths, and that arriving to agreement on their choosing of one of
those several paths would be great, regardless of the specific need or reason that gets
them to choose that good behavior. Look at it like this, if you talk with someone, and
find that together you discover that they should have healthy eating as part of their
life, they could internally have lots of different ways they supported that decision, for
some it may be guilt, others greed, others vanity, others a search for balance, some
want to be stronger, some want to fee, better.

Offer them paths that meet their needs, and you feel are awesome. You don't have to
have the same reason why you think it's awesome, it only matters that they do the
thing, they don't have to have the same ends only the same means.

You should choose your own name, and you should have your own logo, and you
should have your own slogan, and you should have your own unique benefit
statement, if not multiple statements that are relevant to the multiple parties to
which your value is differently measured. Its’ very like that the things your lovers care
about are quite different from the things that your employers or employees or
customers will care about, unless perhaps you're quite promiscuous and in the sex for
hire business, perhaps then a more common statement would fit in all those places.
For the non sex-workers among us, we’re very likely to need a few to do the job
optimally.

Why would I suggest that you do these rare, and rather crazy things? Well, for the
same reason that I would suggest to any business that they do the same. In a world of
limited resources, even the consideration and respect of others is a scarce resource,
and if you to leave the least to chance, and ensure your success in the time you have
here, you might as well do all the things that work. Led Zeppelin and Prince had logos
that represented them.

Businesses will spend millions upon millions of dollars changing a well-known name
they've had for years in the very often belief that a more unique name will get them
higher in the consciousness of their customers and users and therefore is worth the
short term cost of changing to use a different a better name. Musicians and actors
also often take advantage of the ability to choose not only ones clothing but name to
be more exotic and unique, and whereas you have probably not heard of Thomas
Mapother, you have heard of Tom Cruise, they're the same person. Ringo star, Cher,
Prince, Jamie Foxx, and so on, many people have taken advantage of choosing what
their own name should be to meet their own desires in life, instead of using the rather



optimized for someone else's goals name that you were assigned before you were old
enough to have any say in it. I would say that last names are even worse because its
more common to have a good and common first name and a foreign sounding,
unpronounceable, or crappy last name. It's hard for someone to ruin a first name for
you, and pretty easy to ruin a last name. You won't’ find many Hitlers but you can still
find quite many Adolphs. So if you have the courage to optimize your first name, do
find the courage to optimize your last as well.

Now you may have come into the good fortune that your last name is associated with
greatness, perhaps you are a Von- something or another, or you are a Kennedy, or a
Bush, etc., if so, lucky you. Most of us are not. You have to know when a friend is
telling you they think you have some kind of mental problem, particularly the amen
mental problem they have tried to convince themselves that they have, because they
might not be trying to harm you, they might only be trying to get you the same profit
that they found in the believe of the strange mental trait, for instance, some people
want to think they are psychos, but they actually aren't, but they like the idea, and
they want you to be as they are and profit in the fucked up belief as they think they
do. So sometimes hurtful words in their mind are supposed to be helpful.

If your friend loves crack, and it's the best feeling he’s ever felt, he may truly
desperately want to have that feeling with you, and the only way he knows, is if you
too smoke crack, and he’ll show you how. Just because their intention is positive, it
doesn't mean that it's a good idea to do what they want you to do, nor that it's a good
idea forgot hem to be doing it themselves. Crack, and thinking you have problems you
don’t are both bad, even if they might feel good in the short run.

Summary, don’t make problems, you don’t need.

Don’t believe your own bullshit - Spirit

Don’t believe your own bullshit, if you did something great, and you hope to do
something great again, but this time you're not doing got do the thing the same way,
this time you believe your own hype, and don't use the same tools and reference to
excellence that you'd hit the first time, yes you’ll have more of you in the project, and
yes you are likely to make a shit thing, because what makes something great, is rarely
the product of a single persons new ideas, and commonly the product of a single
persons mixing and melding, and building the on the greatest ideas they know, and by
definition those greatest ideas are not their own. If everything you are doing is new, is
probably bad. Or you don't know that it's not actually new, and you wrongly believe
yourself to be the source. You must have objective reasons why something is
measurably good or better, outside your own opinion. Your own opinion rarely
discovers anything new, and often makes only judgments upon others creation.
Creation is harder than absorption and rating. It's much easier to watch a film than to
create a film.

If people call you arrogant, and they only ever hear the goods thing you say about
yourself how could they feel any different, if they weren't there when you were shit-
talking yourself, they have a poor sample size to estimate whether you have a health
opinion of yourself that mirrors reality.



If you are good at something and don't reward yourself by being accurate regarding
your greatness at the thing, you aren't really helping yourself, you're just helping the
shit-talkers of the world that wish you harm, and wish they were better than you.

Now that is to say, you need to be accurate, and hopefully are referencing objecting
measurement that is non biased, to qualify yourself for bragging, or pride. Many the
stupid man claims greatness with only his super biased opinion for evidence.

Be prideful where it is deserved and be humble where it is where appropriate. Don't
mistake the pain losers feel when you remind them through your very existence that
they're not achieving what they could in their lives, and they choose to tear you down,
instead of buildup themselves.

If you were born into this world, lucky enough to be male, and strong, and able to
protect those around you, and instead you identify others weaknesses such as the
weakness of women, children, or animals, as something to be punished instead of
something to be protected, an opportunity to fulfil your birthright as a strong person,
a powerful person, you are probably a piece of shit. Fuck you.

Don't become significant by trying to create or have or identify with problems, you
don't actually need to have. Find a better way.

Vicarious living through getting your friends laid, and girls that are in a relationship
will try to hook you up with other girls because it makes them feel like they had sex
with you, even though they could ding.

Know the difference between when someone wants to take a photo it you and hey,
don't want to actually get to know you, they just want the photo, it's like the Ferrari
Lambo difference between interest in you and the car, and just interest in the car.

If you took their advice and liked yourself less, what good would it do the world?

You'd produce less, you’d take less risk, and you might only hurt them less by
reminding them how they suck, during the few moments you with the player hating
faggots. You re should optimize for the environment you are more commonly in and
pays better dividends. Haters gonna hate.

Don't’ mistake novelty or interest in what is on you, for interest in what is you, or
inside you.

People rarely change for the better, and seem to easily change for the worse.

SCI.80 Our design

So someone's got to break that fucking mold. Someone's got to say, "Yeah.
What are you going to do with your life?"


'I'm going to be a rapper." Be

fucking rapper, maybe bailer, go play in the NBA. Go to bang chicks all da
ong. It's going to be amazing. Well, it's not great that the young people of the

of the


world only have that as a role model, and nothing else. That's it. That's your


ucking - who else could you have as a role model? A politician? Get fucked.
Who? Right. Yeah. Exactly. And that's new. Right. Exactly. And why? Because
we are designed to be powerful, important, sexually wanted. That is what we -
if you don't care about those things, you don't have kids in the game anymore.
Right?

Evolutionary Biology

SCI.3- Pair bonding and our old hardware

In addition, we are dying because our hardwire is bad. Our relationships and
pair bonding relationships, when we have only one partner, are being
destroyed. Though now we have contraception and DNA tests, the same risks
that used to happen because someone "cheated on you" have remained; as for
your offspring, it turns out that your genes have nothing to do with your next
generation because you got tricked into thinking that you already got a kid, but
you did not, as your woman had had someone else's kid. So you got duped and


eliminated from the recorded history unless you started cheating too


. That's


funny, isn't it?

Supernormal Stimuli

SCI.7- Scivival & Supernormal Stimuli-

So I have thought what might be a good name or good belief in science, which
will save our own asses, our species' ass, your beloved ones and your offspring's
asses. How could that be called? I have thought it should include that
component of survival, but survivalists spoil everything. They are programmed
for doing wrong. They collect bullets and guns, but they vanish once the shit
hits fun. It's fun to do this, it's enjoyable, and that's why zombie apocalyptic
movies are so popular. Furthermore guys love all these apocalypse movies


bei

ma




because then they and their personalities actually matter, their life fuckir
latters, but their daily life is nothing. Who gives a fuck for what you are doing?
Oh, you have checked your Facebook, congrats! Oh, you have played a game
and got some new achievements; get my pat on your back. These are our super
normal stimuli as they are called now; it is they that lock us in this horrible
reality.

SCI.79 We Are adapted for scarcity
















































So if you have that belief in anti-scarcity - which by the way is the opposite
belief that people have. Human beings are trained, just like road rage, just like
pair bonding, hating people, cheating, caring so much about significance,
running when you trip. All that shit that's built into us were built to care about


scarcity. So we collect things and we like to collect things that nobody else has,
right? And so we find it hard to understand the way the world really works


with abundance instead of scarcity, exponential growth instead of linear. These


are things that are very hard for us to understand.

Progressively less well adapted

49. You're going to get progressively more and more mal adapted for the world that
you live in because the rate at which society and technology are changing is vastly
exceeding the rate at which we are adapting genetically.

SC1.1- Tribal Psychology


Human beings have evolved to the maximum for the world that no longer exists;
everything we feel today worked very well when we were travelling around in groups


of 50. When someone cuts you off on the road or someone steps on your foot and
screws up your shoes, you get very angry. Do you know there were gangland
shootings in the 1990s? At least have you heard of these types of things? Perhaps, the
knockout game when you see if you can randomly knock people out as they go about
their daily lives, it was a disgusting thing that passed through the United States. Acts
of barbarism such as those ones are well founded in the tribal psychology, and they
serve its purpose.

SCI.40- Need for Social Importance & Approach Anxiety

So here’s what happens in every conversation. In every conversation, the participants
want to look important. It matters. If you travel around a group of 50 people and
you're not important, and there's limited food, well, you might not eat. Sorry. There is
not that much food, and we don't like you that much. So you're going to eat last, or
not at all. Or maybe we'll just kill you because you look stupid. That was the order of
things. That's why when you trip, you act like you are actually about to start jogging.
Because you don't want to look weak, because you'll fucking die. That's why approach
anxiety exists. You don't want to walk up to a random girl and say some shit. Because
if that random girl just happens to be related to or hooking up with tribal leader or
friend of tribal leader, you'll get rocked in the head with a real rock, and killed in your
sleep. And like, the fucking world a couple thousand years ago, it's a pretty rough
place, man.

What you feel is largely what helped us survive

All of the things which we feel are beautiful, for the most part, are there because they
helped us survive, turns out that tin the old days, survival was really, really, hard, so
now we love to look at the ocean, and feel the breeze, which is pretty great, because
fish live in the ocean, and they're tasty, and people from faraway lands that we want
to trade with, they often land from the water, so living near water, it's great, because
it provides us food.

The source of Morals

lots of things that can help us understand and succeed in life can be learned from the
animal kingdom. Retards like to say that we get morality from religion, which is pretty
funny. Let's see, are animals moral, yep, yep they are. do they work in teams and

Things that have Intermittent reward can addict you


348.If it's true that the quality of your life is the average of the quality of emotion


you


have and some things are wildly addicting particularly things that have intermitten
reward like gambling, like sports, competition and like going to bars and trying to be
intimate with people of the other sex even if you don't go all the way to the ultimate
consummation of two people's attraction to each other say, back at home. Well, if you
get good at that, if you get good at poker or if you get good at being intimate with
people in bars and it is intermittent, it will addict you.

Now, what's the problem with being addicted to intermittingly rewarding highl
emotionally involved and charged risk taking behavior and feeling super supe


important because either you won or you made love. What could be more validating
to your value and worth as a human being than someone else wanting to share their
body, the most sacred thing they have with you; alone, away from the rest of the
world. Well, now you've got a problem; for lots of guys they go out and they find that
attraction, they have that experience, they have that fun and then they get too old
and they stop; or, they get too fat and they stop; or becomes too easy and they get
too bored and they stop; or it becomes too hard and the interment reward doesn't
happen enough and they also get bored and frustrated. Mostly frustrated I would
imagine for those guys. So, what's the worst outcome that could actually happen?
That you stayed just the right amount of challenged and have just the right amount of
fun that now it's an addiction that doesn't get replaced, it doesn't get changed. And
so, you don't grow as a person; you don't make business friends because you're hung-
over from what you did last night. You don't have children because you're good at
contraception and you know how to use condoms and that part of your life gets
delayed to the part where it may never occur. You never develop the qualities and
traits which would make you truly worthy of your peers' respect and of the opposite
sexes respect by having success in an area outside of the nightclub.

The mythical value of ancient things

As human beings we spent much of our formative years without written language and
therefore much if not all of the learning that we got from our elders cam in the form
of stories. The keeping of history and the transference of knowledge has existed in
the spoken form longer than any other form we know of. The usefulness of a story
told is in great relation to the ability to remember the story or learn from it, and as
humans we've also developed a keen ability to remember things that we think are
important at the cost of forgetting things that aren't so important. If you take a look
at the "power" section of this book, particularly the mnemonics section you'll find that
if you imagine things vividly with colors and textures and exaggerated size, use motion



















and sexuality or humor, your brain will find them more important, and therefore you'll
be more likely to remember them.

The mystery of the unknown is a very alluring trait, and I feel works as a similar
marker for us to know what is important to focus on. Things that are mysterious are
able to maximally satisfy our curiosity, because by definition curiosity can only be
satisfied by the unknown. This is where we find a hiccup in the otherwise good
programming. Things that are ancient are inherently unknown, because of bad record
keeping, bad communication so that even if good records were kept you might not
ever be delivered the information regarding an event, because everyone that was
there from your team died. Say, a battle, or a natural disaster killed all the potential
message deliverers. There's also almost always a language barrier, because if the
event, or thing, or place which you are feeling mysterious vibes from was over 1500
years ago, The English language didn't' exist yet.

When you combine bad communication with bad recording keeping, and do it in a
language not even spoken today, you've got quite a few good ingredients for
triggering the feeling of mystery. Thus, because we are driven my curiosity, and
because the ancient past due to its obscurity and often unknowable nature, many of
us find ancient things fascinating.

Sadly, sometimes there's things you'd be better off curious about something useful,
instead of something not useful. The longer we exist on this planet creating more and
more history, and fiction, and culture, the larger the set of rather non useful interests
grows, and the smaller the set becomes of really useful interesting things becomes in
comparison. The reality is that the ancient past sucked, and it sucked hard. It's not
very easy to derive value from what those backwards and ancient cultures did. If you
know the amount of human sacrifice that was performed, you'd be shocked. It's
pretty obvious that human sacrifice doesn't get the gods favor, or perhaps you would
see those cultures still in existence, through their harnessing of such power. Fiction is
fun, mystery is fun, however often not so useful.

Look at it this way, if the past was useful, and perhaps better than today, especially
technologically, how would we go about forgetting about those discoveries and not
having them available in the present time? When in the future do you think that the
world will forget how to make the cheese burger? We just haven't had giant wiping
out of knowledge often enough during the periods where history was considered
valuable enough to keep track of to lose chunks of valuable information. And thus
what you end up with is the fallacy of proof by complexity, for the apparent
intelligence and complex nature of a civilization or person lost to ancient history, due
to the fact they weren't effective enough to keep their own records or culture into
modern times. If they were effective enough to be awesome, they'd have been able
to keep good enough records to be not mysterious. Then they would be like the
Greeks and Romans, awesome and respected, however, not mysterious.

If the Egyptians were more awesome and effective, we would know as much about
them as we do the Greeks and Romans, and then they too would be as respected,
however, because they were less effective, and had less of an impact on the world, we



now see them as mysterious. Don't be confused. To be unique isn't necessarily useful
and to be mysterious doesn't mean that you have much to learned from nor that you
should be respected. Don't fall for the appeal to complexity logical fallacy. Anything
that was good enough to kick ass 1000 years ago has been rarely forgotten, and is
now known and respected and thus non mysterious. Most mysterious are actually
quite uninteresting once you are well educated enough to see them for what they are.
You could say much of these same things about numerous ancient and surviving
religions as well. There's one interesting story that I could offer about when we truly
did forget something useful, when the British navy forgot to include citrus fruits on
their ships and lots of people got scurvy.(xx) The set for forgotten and rediscovered
things is nearly infinitely smaller than the set of things remembered.

Don't waste your time focusing on the useless mysterious when you have plenty of
useful mysteries so near. Don't be triggered into interest by complexity, particularly
the complexity of fiction, instead find the myth and mystery of the real world, which is
quite complicated and magical enough on its own.


ancient stuff sucks, that's why its lost and ancient., who cares... Most antiques suck
also

Your feelings are optimized for a world that no longer exists

You face so much less mortal danger today than we ever have in the past, your
emotionally excellent system for the wilderness doesn't work so well in the Wal-Mart.
You're more likely to have a heart attack from overreacting or overeatting than you
are to be eaten by a predator that surprised you.

710 - Colleting, not using - Spirit

It's interesting that fetishism that human beings have, we focus on cars and collecting
them but not driving them. Focus on keyboards and collecting them but not typing.
We'll focus our cameras and collecting them but not taking better photos. Same with
e.g. gym equipment. So it seems rather odd that we focus on the things or then the
activity surrounding the things. If we focused on the activity surrounding the things
that the things were useful for. Then, there would be more training, there'd be more
excellence, there'd be where usage, instead of hoarding.

Nature of reality

Remember when there were words you didn't know, and had to look them up? The
books that had them, used to be confusing to you, and now you love those words and
you may love those books. What changed? Your resolution, your resolving power,
you're ability to discern difference and quality.

Don't take advice on the sharpness of an image or lenses from another man, unless
you know that man actually has a good eye. And I do mean a good eye, I used to have
great eyes, till I got glasses, now I have superhuman eyes. Better vision than most
humans can get even with all the correction you can do. So if I'm able to see things
now that I couldn't' before, how on earth could I expect someone more different than
me than my old self was to my current self to be able to see things the same way as I
can?

of this text right now. You might even hear a strong, deep voice in your mind.

Speaking in a wise tone the words on the pages of this work.

By that same token, know thyself, perhaps you are the one that is myopic and

random chance.

Model of the world

Be free by giving away your freedom
Follow the law

This is what following the law does for you. You submit yourself to the will of
your fellow man, and in return, he will protect your property and your
investments, and enforce your contracts for you. Your fellow man and the
society you live in sets the limits to what you can achieve. If you live in a lawless
land, you can't get too much done in this world.

Anonymity on the internet is nearly impossible

If you clear your cookies, they hide tracking in your flash player. If you clear
your flash player with a special tool, they track what fonts you have installed
and what browser you're using. If you install NoScript, don't load flash, and
somehow magically only allow certain fonts, well now you stand out too. Woe
is the man who desires privacy against a motivated attacker. How few apps that
you want on your phone would work if you said no to all the bullshit
permissions they asked for? Sadly, in this day and age, it's easier to choose to
be a sheep then eat 20 percent of your useful life trying to be "free." One day
when the crypto community has more progress under their belt, you can
readdress the issue with better tools. Right now it takes too much time for too
little gain to maintain privacy.

The utility value of believing things that aren't true.

You want to believe in a thing greater than you because, doing so makes you more
effective, and if you saw that truly the thing above you that was great than you was
the false belief that there was really a thing, and that it wasn't just a way to be more
effective by believing in a thing that may or may not be true, then it would work less
well.

There are all kinds of places in life where inaccurate and unfounded beliefs lead to
greatness, as anyone that has practiced fake it till you make it discovers. So sadly it's
probably much much easier to let people believe that there is truly something greater
than themselves that drives them, then it is to eat the midterm loss of performance of
the shock that it's an illusion, albeit and effective illusion.

Anthropomorphizing emotions

People assign human emotions to gods and we kind of assign emotions to "the
system" (that wants things from us) but there is however a system that's not
anthropomorphized. It doesn't want anything from you. We just have evolved to treat
things as though they were human, because it's more affective that way, because
most of the problems we have growing up were more "human" than "lion" and that's
why we have speech and track eye cues ... I mean shifty eyes mean something...



enough people got killed from shifty eyed mother fuckers for it to mean something. So
part of the reason to measure a gods desires or emotions is funny because if there is a
god he surely doesn't have the same emotions as you do....UNLESS that god system is
actually part of an evolving set of other gods that he has to compete with and mate
with and have limited resources. Maybe human beings are the food it uses to support
itself in the god culture..


302.So watching a movie is a lie. The people in it aren't the people that really did the
thing, the time that it happened wasn't the time it really happened, the rain's usually
fake, the lighting's usually fake, it's all fake, right? But it's awesome, and kind of,
believing religion is the same way. It's an easy way to have an enjoyable, fun, fulfilling
experience in life, unfortunately at the cost of truth and, depending on which religion
you're following and to what degree, could be a lot of violence and killing in there
which is a pretty shitty side effect.


251.Belief in God makes you take a narrative that you think like, "Hey this video game
sucks so bad and going out sucks so if God made it so that going out sucks and video
games suck then He must have done all that just so I could write this book because
there's nothing else to do." So I think that there's like this interesting theory that if
you're motivated and you believe in God depending on what type of, like, belief you
have around what God supposedly did, it may greatly affect your behavior. Now, I
guess this isn't that interesting because it's all totally, you know, up to how you use
your brain, right? There's lots of other people that think the absolute wrong thing and
they do worse off for it. But I felt like recording it because I felt there's some inkling of
learning in that by believing it changes what you do.


261.When you're promised something so huge (life eternal ever after) and the
payment that you have to make for that huge payoff in the future, the small fee that
you need to pay in advance, to get that amazing thing is to love God and do a few
things that you were doing anyway. You know, don't covet thy neighbor's wife. You
weren't doing that because your neighbor would kick the fuck out of you or stab you
or whatever they did back then. Uh, you know, don't murder. Yeah, we weren't doing
that anyway. So you're telling me that I can get all this super-duper cool shit without
really changing my behavior at all and just, like, changing who I say I love?


If I say I love my wife, she wants to talk to me for an hour after work about the dumb
shit that happened there and the gossip that I don't understand or care about, and I
have to listen and love it and enjoy it because I'm a good husband. And she needs to
feel important and I need to listen to what's important to her. When I'm talking about
writing a book or shit she doesn't care about, I expect her to be a good wife and listen
to what I'm passionate about even if she doesn't give a fuck. Well, if you want eternal


everlasting life,
talk to you for z
all you need to

God is never going to call you with how bad a day He had at work and
n hour about shit you don't want to hear. He'll give you all of that, anc
give Him in return is basically nothing. Just do shit that you would've

already done anyway and were already doing for the last religion you were in

























But this one sounds better because maybe they've got less requirements. You know,
you can keep slaves. That's cool. Maybe this other religion doesn't like you keeping
slaves. So fuck. You know, that removes the guilt. I didn't feel good about keeping
slaves, but now that I've switched religions, I not only get this cooler story, right? It's a
better evolved story because it's been told for a couple thousand years so they figured
out some improvements, right? They're like, oh, virgin birth, that worked. Let's copy
that from here. Oh, fucking, uh, you know, talking fire tree. That sounds awesome.
That worked over here. Let's have the talking fire tree. People will respect that shit.
Sea monster - giant sea monster that swallows people and then spits them back up.
Sounds legit. Sounds totally fucking legit, bro. Floods and shit, you know.

I guess you could call that certainty, right? Or, uh, you know, there's... anytime that
you think that there's only, uh, a limited number of things that goes into a
complicated thing, it's very likely that you just don't know all the other things that are
there. You know, if you've got, uh, literally an itch that you desperately feel that you
must scratch, well, what is that? The scratching and itch. Certainty? Is it variety? No, I
think it's just another response to a multivariate, which is a fancy word for, uh, many,
uh, variable inputs that human beings have. Now that is to say there's a lot of very
cool, uh, decisions and learning and things that comes out of using the six human
needs psychology to discover things. It's better than most of the other ones that I've
seen out there, if not all of the ones that I've seen. But perhaps I haven't seen all of
the ones that exist.

I mean, if you look at the variety of human experience, we also have happiness and
sadness. Now are those needs? Do we have a need to feel happy and a need to feel
sad and a need to change our state if you can say, okay, well, the changing state you
can call that variety. What about the happiness and sadness? Are those needs that
you need to feel those? Or not? Mm-hmm. What about all the other emotions? Like,
uh, revenge and rage...guilt. Do you need...are those needs? Is guilt a need? Lots of
people feel it. It seems to be a quite useful way to, uh, gather the wisdom of the
crowds and to personal individual effectiveness. Yes, obviously it is often perturbed
and misused, however I would say, uh, guilt and having a conscience are... is definitely
more good than bad. You know, you could make another nice analogy to understand
the, uh, the inaccuracy of having only six human needs of which two are optional, so
you really only have four. Then, uh, you could just say it's to be or not to be. To do
same or to do different. Well, I don't know, I guess you could learn something from
that. But perhaps if you're a smart dude, you'd be better off with a more in-depth and
nuanced understanding of the human, the most complicated thing we're aware of in
the universe.

The profitable illusion of a soul

It is funny how so many people want to make the division between mind and body,
even soul and mind, then you put them in an arm bar, apply some pain, and all that
fancy crap disappears. Or take the mentally ill, who are totally lost, soul personality,
everything, and you put a little tiny pill of some fancy man made stuff in their tummy,
and they're back, where was their soul when they were crazy? where was everything
that made them so special?







It is useful to think very highly of yourself, and to even thing you are amazing and
special, because to yourself you are truly the most special thing you will every
experience. In reality, the things that make us who we are , are very very modifiable
based on the temperature, how much sleep you have had, whether you have any
mushrooms that make you hallucinate or drugs in your stomachs,
even smart transhumanists think that we can transcend our mortal coil, they think
that we'll be able to digitalize our consciousnesses and live forever, won't that be
funny when the 4chan hackers are pwning your soul, remember, those same 4chan
hackers that are bored and tired of feeling powerless are going to have access to DNA
synthesis and will likely be able to make very dangerous things in their free time.

727 - Deep - Spirit

It's interesting that human beings appear to have the same chemical composition in
ratio that the rest of the universe has, or at least the rest of the earth. The things that
are more abundant on earth, are more abundant in us and things are less abundant
earth or less abundant in us. And i'll credit that cool black astronomer for this
discovery. So he says if you want to think you're special then you could at least be
made of something rare. But instead made of the most common stuff that's around. If
it's really the fact that we evolved from the most common stuff well then it's likely
that life is a rather like... it happens on its own, as long as that stuff's around. And so
my brain was telling me, isn't it interesting that we have self emergent life over and
over again from common materials. However, because of relativity and great
distances we will never meet each other. And so it's an interesting in a separate
universe that we live in where the only two species that evolved separately from each
other and never got to meet were literally ones that survived the opportunities of self-
destruction and lasted so long, that the two parties could actually meet and reach
each other. Then the question arises if two conscious life forms meet each other from
great distances over a billion years you know (xx check that number), but some
extremely, extremely long number of years - would they care about meeting each
other? And then I would say yes they would care, for the same reasons that caring
evolved here, because it's an effective strategy. Those things that don't care they
stopped being around and they don't get to be around for a billion years to meet the
other race. Anything that's around for a billion years, long enough to get to meet the
other race, does in fact care. Therefore, it would be a very interesting meeting and I'm
sure that it would go perhaps with more of a bang than a whimper.

Danger and opportunity happen in an instant

Thus, the single man usually beats the committee.

This is why most successful organizations in the world rest upon the decision of a
single man. If you attempted to replace the man with a committee, the decision
making would take much longer, sometimes to the point of making no decisions at all.
Thus for the same reasons that organizations with a single fast decision maker
outperform organizations that take too long to decide things, you, as an organism
outperform slow thinking creatures with a faster, fight or flight, friend or foe
emotional response.

Psychopaths

A chapter called You really should care what other people think. QR



115. One good argument for caring about others being good is the fact that people
who have the least empathy (psychopaths) end up being very not useful for society.

It is a common saying that you should not care what other people think. This is
completely and entirely wrong, and you already know it. Before I destroy this
common saying, I'd like to impart that I know why it's offered so commonly as
wisdom. Many people care about what the wrong people think. And if not the wrong
people, the wrong timing or angles. Timing and angles, what does that mean? Well, it
turns out that when people judge you or speak about you, they're usually doing it
because it provides them a profit they are unaware of, it just feels good. The reason it
just feels good to gossip and judge others is because it raises your social status among
your peers. It gives an easy target to agree upon which leads to better teamwork and
bonding among friends. TO create an us and them mentality, a collectivism so to
speak, gives the gossipers and judgers a common group for understanding and
behavior that makes them more effective, however at a price. The price is, as soon as
they find profit in praise instead of negativity, they have to eat those words.

Wisdom

Cells divided speaking through Scivivalism

Imagine that you are the cells that divided, over and over again, to organize from a
single cell in our mothers' womb, into the person whose eyes are absorbing the light
of this text right now. You might even hear a strong, deep voice in your mind,
speaking in a wise tone the words on the pages of this work.

Religion

How create a cult - sales through lies

Religion is interesting. If you wanted people to adopt your new belief system over
their current one, a tactic could be to tell them they're allowed to do what they really
want to do (rape, take land from others, keep slaves, subjugate women) and you can
pretend that you're actually restricting them in some way. They don't mind at all. They
don't have the guilt that any normal moral would have regarding the inhuman
treatment of fellow peoples.

It's like selling someone a TV and saying that it was priced wrong and someone is
going to get in trouble if you buy it, it locks the sale in, because they see value in
getting something they shouldn't have gotten. Perhaps in reality that story was made
up, and they bring another "special" TV out for sale once that person leaves the store.

Offering people an excuse to believe that they're paying with effort, that you think is
valuable (not working on Sunday), and pretending you're getting payment from them
for the thing they really want, by faking that they're paying you for the privilege of
doing what they really want, by doing the thing you say you don't want them to do,
which they didn't really every care about much at all. So, man this is really hard to
phrase (whole paragraph is about selling with lies).

So you say you're not allowed to work on Sunday like it's a sacrifice, and they earn
something with that sacrifice, but low and behold, they didn't want to actually work
Sunday at all. And now you've not only given them exactly what they actually wanted,
but you also gave them pride in that they were being paid extra to do the thing that



they wanted to do anyway, and that selling through lies is how you can get your belief
system to outcompete another one.

You can offer them more benefits with less costs, and they won't think that it's fake,
and that they're really just taking the easy way out. Because you confuse the issue
with these false payments, and meaningless not hard to do behaviors that you
"require of them" like saying some prayers that take a minute or two. When all you
really want from them is for them to obey what you say that isn't in the book. To have
your food handed to you by your followers. To have depending on your faith, their
female children handed to you to do with as you please, sexually or otherwise - as the
sole privilege of the leader of a powerful sect or cult, or religion. Who is more
important and secure in a society than the person that's responsible for God's good
will towards you, can you imagine what would happen if you insulted such a prophet?
Well I can tell you what happened in the bible, II Kings 2:23-24, where some children
made fun of God's profit Elisha, and God seeing this sent a pack of female mountain
lions or bears to kill and feast on the children, who if I remember correctly numbered
13.

Calculate what God is

If you want to know whether there's a God, you can look at the way things are built
and just calculate what God would look like from that, which is an idea I had in high
school way back when, it was like "Hey, let's not look at the words, let's look at the
reality."

But people, for whatever reason, back then didn't really think it was a great idea, and
I'm not sure but I think it's a great idea now, because you're kind of
anthropomorphizing reality in ways that don't work for things that aren't human.

McDonalds has more effect than Christianity

The McDonalds franchise is very likely to affect more human behavior on a daily basis
than Christianity and most other religions. It has more employees that wear uniforms,
show up to work, move around more, do more commerce, and serve more customers
or for the church there though. Thus while it is fun to talk about which religions are
the most crazy, it would probably be more useful for humans to start new and






productive business enterprises which truly control the productive hours and
behaviors of this world, at least until a day which I hope never comes, when religions
might control man more than businesses. For then we're surely fucked, and if you're a
woman, wow, epic fucked.

Free will

Sometimes you'll hear very intelligent people say that they imagined a creator when trying
to discover truths about the universe. And they very well probably did, and they may have
gotten the same result thinking that the creator was a bored child with a computer in
another universe, than some superhuman like being. Or perhaps their intellect is forever
colored by the ideas that hit it first, for the same reason that it is colored by the language
that hit it first. The order of operations matter. I would not make the statement that
adopting such coloring is how the world works best. In the end, if you're trying to think
smarter, to some degree, it doesn't matter that much, because on a long enough time scale,
the machines will out think us all,

Please don't try to outsmart the machines, it only works if you 're doing a type of thinking
they can't yet do. And you need the results of that thinking before they figure out how to
do it on their own. It's also pretty damn misleading to refer to the machines as though they
are evolved conscious actors that exist because they care to, they're going to be the agents
of humans for quite a while likely, because we're the result of a couple billions years of life
being rewarded for caring if it existed or not. If you just got to the life party, you might be
the drunk guy who's last words were, "look here at how I can juggle these chain saws!"
Maybe putting in a strong desire to survive at all costs is as easy as entering that command
as number 0 on a list of 3 prime objectives. I hope not. Fighting amongst ourselves is hard
enough without worry about a new conscious actor. If all the machine needs to survive is
power, and not man, is not man then just a risk to him?

Journeys and destinations

Journey and destination, you could focus on streets, or you could focus on
destinations. They're both true, they're both accurate. One way you learn about paths
and methods to do a thing, the other way you learn about the thing, and then






categorize the paths that can get there. One of them makes you good at the journey,
maybe one of them makes you go to the single destination. I think journeys have more
possible outcomes than destinations do.

306.Some people feel really good having a bright future to look forward to. Like if
someone has a vacation planned, they're always excited about having the vacation


planned. So if you have that style of using your brain, it's probably a good idea for you
to always have something that you're waiting on that's going to be awesome. Maybe


for you it's short term and it's Friday, maybe for you it's longer term and it's a trip to
some tropical island. Personally, I couldn't care less about those things, but if you are
a person that responds well to that, execute it and put it on your list of things that are
important that you should do.


Date with destiny


Some part of you knows what the right thing is. Some part of you knows that you're
not doing it to the level that you should, and I can tell you as someone who finally bit
the bullet and did it, when you finally take your fucking destiny, and use the gifts that
you've been given or fought for, you'll feel a fulfillment that you can't find any other
way. You can't find it through diversion, you can't find it through video games, you
can't find it through another woman's arms, you can only find it by knowing that to
some degree, for some part of your life, you're living your destiny. And when you do,
t will become addictive. And it will be the best thing you ever get addicted to.


AMPLIFY: Personal Development/Improvements/ Tools /Strategies for achieving personal goals

Compounding improvements

Whenever you have something with a few parts, and you can improve each of the
parts, the improvements all multiply by each other in ways you wouldn't expect!
Simple example. Lets say you have a website that sells a product called XYZ. This
example website will sell 1 product for 100 dollars with free shipping. 1 percent of
people that visit the site buy it. You pay 10 cents a click to google off an
advertisement that says "buy XYZ product at XYZ.com". You get 1000 visits a day from
your google ad. Your profit per order before marketing cost is 35 dollars.

Your sales per day is $1000. Your profit per day is $350 minus the $100 you gave
google for the 1000 visitors to make your 1 sale. That's $250 total profit per day.

Now we'll blow your mind. For it to be properly blown, please take a second to write
down a real guess as to what you think the increase in profit will be if you do
everything 10 percent better,
x_

Ok, now lets do the experiment.kkk

You change your google ad to "XYZ only $100 at XYZ.com this week!"

Now you get 10 percent more clicks. You now pay less per click (because google
charges you less if you have a higher click to ad shown ratio.) So lets say you pay 10
percent less per click. Now you get 1100 visitors for $99. You improve your website
and now you get 1.1 sales per 100 visitors, and they charge 110 dollars from you, and
your get better prices on XYZ from the manufacturer, so your profit per order at 100
















dollar sale price goes from $35 to $38.50, but you're actually making another free 10
dollars from being able to sell at 110 instead of 100.

Synergy, immersion, Modifying meaning and belief etc. to get good at something
Magic of Meta Synergy

The magic of synergy Meta: This needs to go in the spirit section as well.

If you improve each of yoru skills that effect each other by 10 percent, you
get 100 percent more profit.

Hobbies synergy

Choose your hobbies wisely, you only have time for a few. Ideally they could amplify
each other! If you love having sex with beautiful people, it'd probably be great if you
loved exercise as wel. If you just happened to enjoy being playful and fun, and
confident, all those hobbies would mesh wonderfully together. They're not magic.
They can be learned and practiced like anything else. TLDR if your hobbies all amplify
each other, you get exponential returns. Look at it this way.


Lets do the math. Let's say you like to go to nightlcubs. And Let's say you have a cool
conversation with 1 out of 5 people you approach. Lets say you have sex with one out
of every 12 people you have good conversation with. META:someone else can stick
some examples mathematically in here using the insights from "the magic of synergy"


Immersion, and getting good at something- Power

241.You know if the principle of, uh, the law of attraction was truly accurate than
anyone that you saw with a high close count on a form of business start-ups or, uh,
perhaps with a high profile on that, uh, website where people invest in things. I think
it's called angellist.co - well, any of those guys are obviously immersed and obviously
have high hopes, and yet very few of them are wildly successful. Some of them,
perhaps, even end up losing money. So *clears throat* it makes you wonder, doesn't
it enhance your likelihood to be constantly immersed in the language of some activity.
Does it, you know, improve the likeliness that you'll get good at it? Yeah. I think so.
But, uh, being near it is no excuse for being good at it. And being good is a hell of a lot
harder than being near. And, uh, finding things that other people haven't noticed is a
hell of a lot harder than thinking the same things everyone else thought.

Modifying Meaning and belief to execute a specific program
















































188.Its meaning and belief. I chose to enjoy the suck. I chose to see the pain as a goal.

I chose to embrace the suck and embrace the pain. And want it. I consciously chose
that. Now, I'm conditioning, my body, to stop fighting, and to be like, "yep, this is
what we do now. " When we feel uncomfortable and the suck kicks in, and the horror
kicks in, and the fucking compulsion kicks in to read all the websites and play all the
games and fuck all the girls and stop being conscious. Whatever it takes to stop being
conscious. I got to do whatever it takes to stop existing. I got to execute a program so
hard and so fast at such a speed over and over and over again until I can't think
anymore. Because all of my thinking is being used

Chosing the meanings that empower you

should choose the meanings in your life that give you the most power. If you're smart
and creative, you can literally create compelling meanings and perspectives from
many different sides of an argument. Hell, if you want to , you can even convince
yourself of a lie, even live that lie.. It's all fun and games until you wake up one day
and can't live the lie, can't suppress the truth, some people off themselves, some
people break, some people are born again, greater.

What you think is fate is really popularity. Chosing meanings

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law of attraction (New Thought)

Write this: that above text on serendipity describes how what you think is fate, is
really popularity, confirmation bias, and the reticular activating system, not fate. I
would file it under spirit

ALSO YOU get to choose meanings regardless of events, so you can call lots of things
whatever you want.

Programming for precursor behavior instead of results.

So even though jealousy doesn't lead you to a specific outcome, since there is a finite
number of things that lead to the outcome that you want. It's a good intermediary
step that gets the same benefits. It is the same like having kids. You don't have to
program people to want to have kids, but rather you have to program them to want to
have sex, even though they don't want the kid they want the sex they end up with the
kid, because the sex leads to the kid so you can lead to an intermediate step. Just like
school you might not want to get a job, but you don't want to get arrested or have
your parents yell at you so they tell you to go to school, and then in the end you end
up with a job that you are qualified for because you had the schooling.

Leveraging and ratcheting emotions & Behaviors to achieve

Staircases, happiness and antilock brakes. A widely applicable Powerful Analogy(This
could be split up to other sections like power& Mind)

Perhaps a ratcheting ebb and flow stair climb upwards is wise. Achieve, enjoy, grow
bored, move on up. Maybe that is an optimal strategy? What is it that makes
ratchets and stairs so much better than ramps anyway? I wonder what the universal
principle is there. You're leveraging the power or starting friction by locking and
unlocking like antilock brakes? Interesting. This is a great analogy for study. We use
stairs instead of ramps because on a ramp, it's too easy to go from starting friction to
rolling friction. With stairs, once you get your foot and weight on the next stop, it's
very hard to slide back down. This is likely why we have so much segmentation and
ratcheting in our emotions and behaviors. Even find grained measurements are hard
to make, for instance, why do we only name ROYGBIV in the rainbow? Why not all the
in-between colors? Why do we count in base 10 instead of base 20? Why do we












describe the tons of music as highs, mids and lows. We're amazingly course in our
measurements and even our feelings. 12 average feelings a day. Total.

Xx meta: Perhaps our the courseness of measurement fits well with the, no two rulers
are the same size perception issues. This is more of an emotional angle though, so I'd
probably leave this in emotions, rather than the idea that there's no such thing as
equal in the phyiscal world


Find empowering beliefs for things that happen

Stop saying everything happens for a reason. It doesn't. Chance really does exist. Thus
whether there's a good reason or not, you can still find an empowering belief out of
all events good or bad. And it can be tilted one way or the other just go to any casino
and see for yourself how the biggest buildings in the southwest united states are built
on the slight tilting of chance. If you're stuck in thinking life sucks mode though, you
can be accurate and say, you turn bad outcomes into good fortune wherever possible,
and that can be both true and empowering while allowing your world view to include
that random events do truly exist. Get all the benefits of saying "everything happens
for a reason" and live in the real world. You don't need to destroy your understanding
of the really useful conception of chance in order to feel good.

Frustration & defrustration timing- spirit

245.Due to the complicated nature of the world in which we find ourselves, the times
in which frustration was properly timed to restrict resources while still engaging in


risk-taking, adventurous behavior. Uh, now the things that we need to do are so
complicated that it's very, very hard for us to see 5-minute payoffs and 10-minute
payoffs and however-long payoffs when things take decades now. So I think that we
could benefit from using our minds and perhaps some type of chemical that DE
frustrates us so that we can stay engaged in a task.

Select the activity instead of selecting excellence- Spirit

452.Isn’t funny that the Nike brand started out with Greek imagery, and Nike being
the God of victory, and then the brand literally thought, "Oh, victory is too hard.
What's not

too hard? Just doing it! I mean fuck win or lose, just doing it has got be easier. "Right?
So fuck selecting for excellence, let's just select for activity.

No immersion in mental space- Spirit & Schedule(Goes in alot of places)

456.So, when you're trying to change the way you think about things, you have two


options: you can either immerse yourself and make thinking the right way so easy that
it's what you do. You wake up, you don't care whether you feel like it or not, you do
the thing that you're supposed to do; it's scheduled and you fucking do it. And it
doesn't take will power because it's engrained as a habit.


Well, mental habits are very similar to physical habits except that you don't get the


ease of scheduling them. So you don't get the ease to feel a certain way about a thing
because you've scheduled it. If you want to change the way you feel about reality
television per se, you can't schedule a time to decide that you're going to feel that
reality television is a waste of your time. You need to just program that emotion
without the short cut of immersion, without the short cut of scheduling. You can use
the NLP switch pattern kind of style: see this, do this, see this, do that not that, not
that NLP works for the most part but that one kind of does.

































So what you end up with is the human emotion of frustration. Frustration is triggered
upon what is, it is not triggered by what is not. Okay? So greed is triggered by what is
not; greed is the thing that I want and I don't have it right now. And so, what doesn't
exist triggers greed and therefore movement in that direction. Whereas frustration is
triggered by what is. Here is the thing and this thing fucking sucks, and now let's go do
the other thing.


Pulling & Pushing emotions

So, we've got pulling emotions and we've got pushing emotions; we've got towards


emotions and we have away emotions. And so, if you're trying to build a new belief,
and a new strategy, and a new way of thinking about things as much as you may try tc
always stay in a positive frame you'll find that it's harder and that sometimes you just
need to program and think about identifying the wrong way so that it gives you a


trigger that you notice, "Oh. I'm doing this the wrong way, let me do it the right way."

I don't want you to live there. I don't want you to spend time there. I only want you to
think about problems long enough to develop solutions, and focus on solutions.

But in the area of human thought, you don't get to immerse yourself. Shit is going to
pop up, conversations are going to pop up, social media is going to pop up, you're
going to stub your toe, life is going to happen, and then you're basically you're back in
la la land and you're going to fall back into old habits and you need to know, "Hey, old
habit. Okay, I see it. It's triggered me, now what do I do? What's the right habit?" And
so, in this instance my old habit was maximizing for market share, maximizing for
profitability and basically the mind of a sales man, the mind of a marketer and that is
not going to save my life, that is not going to save my loved ones' lives and that is not
going to save the planet.

I need to program myself and learn to think in a way where the profit is the
wholesome sometimes financial, often times not financial getting of human beings to
take responsibility for saving their own lives. And the sooner that I can start justifying
my actions, and my beliefs, and my thoughts and my behaviors by noticing my old
school style of profitability, my old school style of scale and saying, "Hey. That was
great for then when money was the object but money is not the object now." So let's
creating and memorizing these new frame works of getting people to care about what
really matters. QW.456
Doing what you know you should do

Motivation and desire are wildly more important than knowledge.

Basically, the world is not short on things to know or amazingly complex things that
can suck away all of your time that you may never fully understand, those things don't
matter.


What matters is doing the things that we already know that we should do.


It's funny how much effort and time goes into the education system and not the
motivation system. Kids would be better off going to 50% of their time getting


motivated to do shit and of their time 50% learning what they needed to, to do those
things. Than spending 100% of their time learning things they will never use, can't use,
don't want to use, shouldn't learn. How many people have a collection of exercise
equipment in their house that goes unused? How many people have the ability to do
push-ups because they have arms and they have a floor or not sure on the ability to
exercise or not sure on the knowledge on how to exercise. We are short on the desire
to exercise.

















If you compare the papers that have been released in the systems of doctrinaire and
education, and you compare all of the output in regards to IQ testing instead of
motivation testing; IQ score instead of motivation score; memory ability instead of get
you done ability; reasoning ability instead of get you done ability; creativity instead of
get you done ability. It just seems like getting shit done is the most important thing


ind the least taught thing


123. The world does not need more knowledge the world needs more motivation.


With the advent of forty dollar tablets, and twenty dollar smart phone, and somebody
else being able to watch it and tell you how to do it. You could do anything you want
for yourself if you are motivated to watch a video and try it.


benef

thing.


428.If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in order to create some positive


enefit to the world, you need to know how to do a thing and then actually do the


hing. Well then, which of these two is the weaker thing? Is the world more lacking in
the ability to do things or is it more lacking in the desire to do things? And I will tell
you what the world is missing is desire. For everyone would have a six pack and
everyone would be fit and everyone would spend time with their families and


everyone would do all of the things that they know they should do but they don't have
lack of knowledge on how, they have a lack of desire to do so. QW.428


Discipline shits on motivation

Discipline shit's on motivation. Measure the 2 mindsets, see where all the good shit in
the world is coming from. I bet you find a bunch of tortured fucking souls that are out
there kicking ass while sad, as opposed to the happy go lucky nigger smoking pot and
not doing dick

Difference between motivation and discipline is

Discipline is the most direct-bare metal doing of the thing possible, and motivation is
not doing the thing, it's doing the emotions around the thing, and emotions are very
slippery and they're very hard to hold on to, so let's say you wanted to hit something
with a stick. Discipline is.... You grab the stick and you fucking hit it. Motivation is you
circle jerk yourself and make yourself happy and make yourself feel good about it
reach and grab the stick because you feel good doing it.

Naming your company

https://www.igorinternational.com/process/evocative-product-company-names.php

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgor Naming Agency
Make more give later, or make less give now?

This is like choosing where you want your horsepower in your engine, do you want it at the
low rpm, high rpm, or midband? They're style choices.

Capitalism gives people more of what they want. What people want, usually isn't so great.
Because unfortunately it is often not going to save anyone's life. Bigger houses, faster cars,
more expensive jewelry, how many of these things are what you will remember on your
deathbed as what mattered?

Thus you must choose, do you want to get rich the easy way first, giving people what they
want, and then try and do good in the world (the Bill Gates method) or should you take the
harder route, and get rich by making the world a better place along the way?

Xx where go? What is Technology doing for us?

The technology is letting us do some cool things today that we couldn't do before. In
Sweden, there's a program that if you give blood in your blood gets used to save somebody.
You get notified about that. Well that's pretty cool if people are going to do good things and
get good results for the world. It seems like a great idea to actually let them know about it
seems like a great idea to reward good behavior. It's also an app that allows you to act as
the eyes of a blind person. When a blind person might need to see something you have to
describe to them.

Since they're blind, they can do it with their smartphone. Let someone else tell them what
you know their phone is looking at. That's pretty cool because we've got other cool things
like turning off a car sitting in a park parking lots in the world that have the ability to
transport people and stuff into you know, needing less cars on the road because we can use
all the cars that are just sitting at rest in parking lots to do good things for the world and
move people around. Well then you don't need as many cars. You could take the fewer cars
that you have and get more performance out of them.

That's why art of why Uber is worth billions upon billions of dollars even though they don't
really own any cars. It's because they've allowed a strategy to exist whereby other people
that have unused resources like cars or like Air BnB did with housing that were going
underutilized now we can maximally utilize the things that we've already worked hard to
build and maintain. And you know. I guarantee you that there's probably some more
industries that are underutilized that somebody is going to come in make a couple billion
dollars off of find a way for us to get more of what we already have.

R320

I think one of the better things that can come out of this digitized world, is better
cooperation. Now if you let someone rob you, you have not only turned them into a bigger
piece of shit, because you offered them such great profit. You also lost money and a friend,





or money and a relationship. Now you have also sent a pointer that anyone else that wants
to make money has that as a behavior that they can do. Its just all around bad.

R420 & QW.420

The checkpoint is that if you were restrict the ask to a small set of years that is introduce
technologically and not through lifestyle and health change because you know then people
would have to work on the technology, then the benefits of the other side of that
checkpoint are economic benefits by not having to pay for that last year of life whose
medical costs are equal to all the previous years of life combined and the insane increases in
proactivity by having the smartest, most effective, most productive scientist, researchers,
avengers of the world.

The Edison's and Alexander Graham Bell just got around a couple more years just to finish
up those things they didn't just get around to. Now we got scientific, economic you know
maybe you use one extra year off your life to say goodbye to your family and tic some boxes
off of your bucket list. Restricting it to and I haven't chosen the right number is to what
people will understand that we need to get through technology so whatever they think you
need to get through lifestyle change plus a year or 2 which will get them to care about
technology that's the checkpoint.

Introduction

Funny thing about money

The funny thing about money is that if you properly get the most value from it, and turn it
into goods and services, you don’t actually have it anymore. If you used it to buy a business,
what you really bought was goods and services for other people, because that is what
businesses do. Really all the cool things that people want, that they need money to buy,
they don’t really go in the money section, they go in the environment section.

Now in theory, the ones that you could own but not have in your environment would just
really affect your internal environment emotionally knowing that you own them, even
though you wouldn't be physically in their presence. I'm not sure how I feel about using the
term "internal environment" to describe feelings, maybe it's more useful than confusing.

Mindset

Caring about money

Imagine that When you closed your eyes, millions of dollars were put in your bank account,
and sometimes taken out, they came and went like breath. Would you feel it? They why do
you care so much about how much money you have that you're not using? Once you
become wealthy, you're feel the need to get more and more, and for most, it never goes
away, the greed, the desire, trapped by success. You become your work, you become your
bank account, it's a terrible thing to happen to a man really, for how can he cleanly decide



what he wants from his life when he has so much risk if he changes, and he gets so much
reward by staying the same.

Valuing income over savings.

Some people are happy to get a 50% discount someplace where they're valued.

Others are happy to say they get half off the planet, because they've got twice the
income.

Sayings

"If you're so smart, how come you ain't rich?"

If you ain't rich, life's a bitch.

Warren Buffett, the difference between rich people, and really rich people, is that really rich
people say "no" to almost everything.

Appreciating money: Gratitude / economics in society

II tell you this story because this is the world we live in today. Some people have lots of
stuff, and some people have no stuff, and when you think about how that actually occurs at
the micro level, it goes like this.

You wake up in the morning, have a nice coffee and a shower, and you decided you're
going to build yourself a nice addition on your house. Nope. You can't, because you
have to go build an addition on someone else's house instead so that you can buy
food, and pay your rent. What you find is that your days are almost constantly going
to enrich the lives of other people instead of yourself, because well, one, you don't
really want more of what you can already do for yourself, you're probably bored of it
by now, and two, you are in debt because you need so many things from everyone
else around you. You wouldn't have the time in the day to both go pick your own
food, and water your own lawn, and take the kids to school, I think you get the idea.

So the point is, in this world, instead of spending your days improving your existence
by your own hands, you improve others existence.

This is me trying to phrase the above better:

I want you to imagine that you were the only person in the world. You
needed to pick your own food, build your own shelter, make your own
fires, etc. One day you decided that you wanted to build a house, and in
that house you would like to have some furniture. How long would it take
you to put it together? Perhaps you'd never have a house at all, but give
up and just try to find an ok cave to stay in.

Now why is this interesting enough to even mention. For the reason that you have to be
more happy about what you have in this world. And if you have lots, its because you have
quite literally robbed and starved other people of the fruits of their own labor. So you really
should appreciate it. If you currently own, use, and benefit exclusively from lots of stuff,
and you couldn't have built all that stuff on your own. You better get grateful.

Someone else had to build something for you, instead of themselves, or you wouldn't have
it, unless they died and left it to you.

Money and power isn't everything

Here's Obama while president of the USA interviewing Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, a

a multibillionaire, and put him in the center of the stage with our president off to the side.

Ownership

Loss periods

Why would you want to own anything that has periods of loss greater than 2-5 years?
You would be better off not owning anything in that case I think. Perhaps you're
hedging?

Ownership vs solitary professions

Ownership and business are easier ways for making lots of money than solitary
professions.

The most solitary professions are also often the hardest to compete in. Since the most
rewarded and powerful concept in the world we live in is the concept of ownership
and property, then anything related to business, investment, capitalism in general is
aligned with that most powerful of principles. Thus, you kind of get to cheat the
system a bit, because not everyone else is interested in taking advantage of that
capitalist magic for themselves. This leaves you free profit left on the table that they
weren't interested in. So they go off and compete against each other in the insanely
hard to achieve in areas of art, or fiction writing, or music, instead of business. It's like
going off to war with no guns or weapons and just going bare handed. Sure, you might
be able to do ok, but it's much easier if you take a force multiplier with you.

If you choose a solitary way to make money, you've left behind some of the easiest
"don't leave your force" multipliers behind. Don't try to change the tire on your car
without a jack. Don't try to skydive without a parachute. Don't try to get rich without
ownership.

Productive land

A useful trait buying productive land or companies has is that you're less likely to sell
the whole thing off and more likely to spend only out of your profit, than you are with
a stock, or other lump sum speculative instrument, because it's harder to separate in
your mind that you had a profit from a trade, and that you should only spend the
profit. You can also much more easily find yourself without any income or any gain, or
having to sell of a little part of your business every time to create profit, because
that's what it is. If your stock appreciates and you want to eat, you have to sell some
of your stock, so you're actually constantly owning less and less of that actual
productive thing that you own, which is the company, because you need to get money
out to eat.

Well, that sucks. That's part of the reason that when someone tells you that you need
to use compounding interest, save forever and never take anything out, because one
day when you can't go back in time and buy back quality of life in earlier years, you
have more money than you need. Yay. Now you have more than you need, by going
without for so long. I'm not very interested or excited about testing to the limit
everyone's delayed gratification muscle. I'd rather see you become excellent and
make money by making the world a better place than sitting on your ass and letting



compounding try to make up for your personal suck. Go forth and kick ass, fuck
compounding interest. You need only make 70k a year to get maximum emotional
benefit in this year of no lord 2016.

Compounding interest

I probably won't reference the science of this shit, and make it more folks
knowledgeable

I don't like this 75k thing http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full, let's
look at how inaccurate this number is

Do you have addictions like gambling and drugs? You need more money.
Do you have kids and a trophy wife? You need more money.

Do you live in a super expensive place like San Francisco or NY city? You
need more money.

Are you shit with finance and have lots of debt you need to pay off? You
need more money.

Saving up for retirement? Well is that 5,10, 20 percent of your salary?

You need more money.

With all the variance between different locations, lifestyles, and luck, it
seems pretty silly to slap 75k on the price tag and call it quits. How useful
is this number to people living outside the United States? Not very. See if
the cost of living adjusted this? That would make it slightly better. How
many people do you know that actually got rich this way? Only through
compounding interest.

Unfair world

If you look at anybody that's really wealthy and they have something expensive, that
took many men a long time to build. Maybe it's a house, maybe it's a car. It just shows
kind of the unfairness in the world that ten men had to sacrifice all of their time for
the joy and benefit of one man. It's a little bit interesting, and why do they do that?
Because he was here first, it's a little weird.

Stupid copyright law

Our small world programming for property being a thing and making great sense
was extended to these new giant things that we couldn't dream of back then,
and its rather perverse. Intellectual property is even funnier, how can you own
an idea? Literally own it. And then own it 50 years after you are dead. What the
fuck? Do you really need to own shit while dead?

The mega-corporations win every day, the public loses.

Get rich slow

Let’s be serious, if everyone that read a book on how to get rich, became rich, there
wouldn't be many poor people in the world. How easy it would be to read a get rich quick
book and get rich quickly. The world has no shortage of get rich quick books, however, you
could say that the world does have a shortage of rich people. So how does that happen? You
could say that reading a book on its own doesn't do much. These types of books have been
coming out for thousands of years.

People sell you on doing what they used to do, but not what they're doing now. You'll see
that they found greatness the minute they stopped doing what they're trying to sell you and



started doing what they're doing to sell you. They're selling shovels to gold miners, not
mining for gold.

You only hear about the fake feel good, not hard work methods of improvement. Rarely will
someone tell you that in order to kick ass and outcompete others, you have to learn the
hard shit that you didn't want to learn in school, because that's the most useful stuff. Like
statistics, and the method of loci, and excel formulas. It’s not fun, it’s not pretty, and it's the
real world. The real, sustainable world desires facts and figures, and feats of artistic
excellence, all of which require time, effort, dedication and a foundation of study that has
no shortcuts. Good luck getting people to buy that book.

No one buys the "Get rich slow" scheme.

Tommi: "What if they do? What if people are so disillusioned by the get rich quick schemes
that if someone actually just told them step by step how to get rich in two years, country
specific. Goddamn if they don't want to read that shit, the people who actually willing to
work to become rich."

Wealth Velocity (Getting it Now, the When)

If you really want to make the world healthier, happier and smarter, billions of dollars are
going to be generated. The difficulty of how hard it is to make genuine change in people's
lives through for-profit corporation. It's much easier to negatively affect people's lives with
a for-profit corporation, because there's more barriers to entry which allows for profit.

Things that influence people at younger years and things that influence people at older
years, everyone that's joined the giving pledge, they were reached out by a man, who tried
and spent hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable endeavor. Good ideas cause
absolutely gigantic multiplier effects in money, that no matter how hard you work, you will
never be able to achieve personally.

If you tell someone "Listen, come build this house, I'm going to pay you on Friday" and he
says "I don't think you're going to have the money to pay me on Friday, I need to get paid on
Monday." Then you go to the person that's paying to get the house built and you say "I
wouldn't normally need so much money upfront, but everyone wants to be paid on Monday
instead of Friday now, so I need more money upfront." And that guy replies "It doesn't look
like you've got control of your workforce, maybe you pay them on Monday and it never gets
built, so I don't feel comfortable giving you the money now." So it just goes up the chain.
That's the paralysis of this boom and bust cycle, where you give away credit for free and
then you constrict it. When it constricts, everyone goes into safety/security/savings mode,
and then the money multiplier effect causes the money not to get. In case you didn't know
it, the money multiplier effect means that for every dollar you spend, that's someone else's
income.

For every dollar that you give them, they now are very likely to spend roughly 80% of it. It's
different in different societies. In America, we have a very high money multiplier effect
because we have a very low propensity to save, whereas in China, they have a very high
propensity to save, and therefore their money multiplier effect is lower. If you were to put
$100 of your own money into building something in China, the net benefit to that economy
would multiply less. It would turn over fewer times, because it would get sucked off into



savings and buried in the ground, or whatever form of savings that they would perform. The
funny thing about savings is that unless they just bury it in the ground, if they put it into a
bank, the bank tries to counter-reallocate it. If you're in a country that has a big propensity
to save, you're probably also of the mindset that you don't want to take additional loans,
because that's the opposite of saving. Taking on debt and owing people money is the
opposite of having extra money.

What I'd imagine in countries that save more than other countries, they also probably also
take out less loans, and thus are less likely to have exponential growth because the money
multiplier isn't as strong.

When people want to make a lot of money and get rich, I try and tell them to get on the
sales side because it's got exponential growth capacity whereas cost savings, manufacturing
differences and those things do not have exponential growth capacity at all unless you
combine them with the required sales increases.

Pennywise dollar foolish

The way that human beings treat large purchases with even less care than they do small
purchases, like the purchase of a house or starting a business opportunity/franchise, pretty
much means that those industries are the most ripe for unethical business tactics, because
the same unethical tactics earn you more than they would with lower ticket items.

People usually spend more time investigating a two hundred dollar television purchase than
they will a two hundred thousand dollar house or a two hundred thousand dollar business.
This is because we do not properly allocate our conscious decisions on these giant, hard to
understand numbers.

A dollar saved is a dollar earned. A pound lost stays lost forever. Original quotes I don’t like
in form, however, I do like in function "A penny saved is a penny earned" - "Pennywise,
pound foolish", linear expectations for constant correct behavior. Every dollar you save now,
every dollar you save stays. Same with calories.

New car lease vs buy

The point at which a car goes down in value the fastest is when it drives off the factory
lot, which makes good sense because, why would you pay the same for a car that just
drove off the lot, when you could walk a couple feet farther, and have a direct
relationship with the dealer.





Thus, when you lease a new car, and you keep getting new leased cars every couple of
years, you keep losing the maximum amount of value on the car because you keep
owning it during the period where its value is going down the fastest.

You also pay the maximum number of transaction overhead costs and visits to the
dealer, and spending time choosing which car and specs you want. Then on top of all
that, you're also paying extra interest on borrowing the money to pay back the loan
that you got to pay for a car that is going down in value the fastest it ever will during
its lifetime. Oh, and you've entered the GOTHCA went over mileage insane fees
lottery, or other hidden fees lottery. And you have to have a higher spec of insurance
sometimes to protect the leasing companies interest in your car.

Thus, if you want to save money on a great car, you can own it when it goes down in
value slower, after some other dumb-dumb has already paid to drive it off the lot for
you. Another fun fact, let's say you buy a performance car like a BMW M3, you can't'
even rev the engine to max during the first couple thousand miles because the engine
is still breaking in. Why would you want to own a performance car during the period
when its performance is crippled?

Also you're forced to do extra transactions after a lease, whereas if you own, you can
just hold forever, and skip the transactional costs and friction

Food

Beans and rice

Make your expenses seem gigantic by figuring your actual disposable income

It's only 10 bucks a month. It's easy to say that, because you look at your total income
and think "what's 10 bucks out of 2400 dollars a month?" But is that the right way to
look at it? You have real bills you have to pay every month. So why don't we take that
10 bucks out of the money you actually have available to you. 40 hours, 15 dollars an
hour. $600. 4 weeks in a month. $2400. Minus rent $1200. Gas $200. Phone $60.
Car insurance $100. Food $1500. Internet $60. So now what you really have left is
2400-(1200+200+60+100+1500+60)=-720. So it's really 10 bucks a month out of $720.
Uh oh. You do pay taxes right?

So in the $30,000 bracket you lose about 18% to taxes. Which leaves you with only
$1968 a month. So it's really =-1152

Now if you never buy yourself clothes, never see a movie, never have to fix your car,
never take a flight, never get a speeding ticket, never have any other expenses at all,
your just 10 bucks a month is actually 10/1152. 1968-(1200+200+60+100+1500+60)=-
1152 Wow. So if you spend 1200 on rent and 1500 on food, you're already gone over
budget by 25% of your salary after tax. So uh. You're already in debt $1152 a month
before you gave away the just 10 bucks.

It's hard to show how important 10 dollars is, when you can't even divide it into a
positive number, but are already in debt, so you have to just add it to your monthly
debt. Let's say you only eat McDonald's meals. $6 a big mac. So 3 meals a day, 30
days, $6*90=540. Let's say you get your rent is only $800 a month. Now you are at
$1968-(800+200+60+100+540+60)=$208.00 So just 10 bucks is going to come out of



the $200 you have left end of month, if you never buy anything, ever and only eat
McDonald's meals, no deserts, ever.

Oh, and we forgot electricity, water, garbage, home insurance, health insurance,
girlfriend, pet, family, cable. So, you're pretty much screwed. Do not give your money
away. What about all those other things that show up on your credit card bill that you
never got around to canceling?

You probably need to eat rice and beans, and pay down that debt. Affordable healthy
food is a great start to making money appear where there was none.

Employment is a problem, not a solution
Automation is our friend

Imagine 100 years ago you were a musician, and you heard that there was a new
device that was going to take your job. This magical device would allow people to
record a better musician than you, on the same instrument that you play, and
everyone else in the world would be able to listen to that better musician perhaps
with a better instrument from the comfort of their home, over and over again for free.
You would be pretty scared and pissed off right? You would no longer be as needed
as you once were. The benefits you would need to provide people in order for them to
choose seeing you and hearing you instead of seeing or hearing the recorder better
musician would have to increase. The point is, what makes a better world? Are there
more people listening to music or performing it? It is obvious the world is better off
with the ability to make recordings of our loved ones an music and film. The world is
vastly better off than it once was, and yes at some time in the long ago past, some
musicians actually had to take a hit, for the world to become greater.

Pay the affected minority

It is always better to move the world ahead at the cost of a small minority, for that
small minority can be easily compensated out of the mass earnings that come from
implementing the better world, if you choose to do so, or they can just live off the
saved earnings their monopoly power used to afford them. Or they could change
jobs, etc.

Peak horse population occurred in xx

The car made the world a better place than the horse, few people know that New
York was worried to be literally covered in feet deep horseshit over time, because it
was accumulating faster than they could clear it xx (fact check this)

Firing people is good



Consumers prefer better quality products at ever lower prices. Businesses produce
goods and services for their customers and usually maintain a workforce of people to
execute the tasks required to fulfil their customers. Usually when lots of employees
are laid off, it is because there has been a downturn in business, or the jobs have been
moved to somewhere where the people will work for cheaper. This is complained
about by the employees and by the general public and politicians. It's often not
complained about by the company managers and shareholders though, and often the
value of the company rises. So what's going on here? Why is it that the same event
causes such a difference in emotion. Well the answer you see, in that case, is that the
workers do not give a shit about the plight of the poorer people who are now doing
for less the same job they used to do for more. They couldn't give a shit less about
those people. Do not know their names, haven't been where they live, and often can't
even speak the same language, so it's quite easy for them to ignore the plight of the
people that need the jobs more.

i. The people in charge of the company are legally obligated to look after the

shareholders' interest by maximizing the profit of the company. If there's worse off
people in the world that can do the same job as well or better than the higher paid
better-off people currently doing it, it's the directors of the companies job to do the
more profitable thing.

Xx this chapter is a little confused because it hits he points of both fairness in globalization,
lack of empathy by the common worker, as you could expect from the common man really.
But the topic was supposed to be about how automation taking jobs is better.) So I'll get
back into that. Also is it better for poor people to work for a pay that's not considered to be
fair?

Automation taking jobs is great. Thus, the man who invented the phonograph, which
allowed us to make recordings of sound and play the sounds back where and when we
wished, did the world a great, great favor. We have similar improvements to our technical
abilities as a race quite often these days. Nearly anything that slows that progress shrinks
the pie from which we all must eat. Technology enlarges the pie for all, and it's the job of
our social systems and governments to make sure that no one party is overly harmed in that
progress, and to redistribute the earnings from technological progress across the people.
There is no good in this world but for that which benefits man. Without man, there is no
good.

Funny enough, if you don't appreciate wealth redistribution, you must never have met a
man destroyed by wealth. Too much wealth is much more a burden than a blessing. How
many lottery winners are better off from becoming wealthy? The point is, owning a thing
basically just means the right to make sure other people don't get to use it. It's a right of
exclusion. How noble is that really? That you get to control the location and use of a thing?
Seems pretty greedy when you put it that way.

Thus, technology is all that will save us. Some groups will get less pie of the enlarged whole,
it's the job of governments and society in general to see that these harmed parties are still
made well, so that other parties in the future see less benefit in slowing down the progress
of the world.



The means of solving the problems of the middle and lower classes is outside the abilities of
technology. The rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting richer, except in
percentage terms compared to the rich.

Wouldn't it be funny if we lived in a world where there were only very, very wealthy men
who lived on the moon, and left all their possessions here on earth. We would live in their
houses, swim in their swimming pools, and they would never bother to even see them. Of
what use is owning a thing you can't see, and do not use? Its social signaling value, and
fulfilling your greed, or hoarding desire I guess.

The point is, don't fuck technology to try and make up for bad governance and wealth
distribution. If you do, you'll still have a bad government, and you'll still be broke, however,
you'll also have no cool tech.

The rising tide rises all ships so they say.

Choosing a profession

Caring about the world beyond your paycheck

How many people want a job, any job that pays well and isn't too hard. Why would
one restrict themselves to a vision that sees no farther than their paycheck and day at
work. We live in a world, where people don't really care too much about what the
actual result of the work they're doing is. If people cared more to be doing work that
actually made the world a better place, than it would cost less to get people for those
wholesome and productive jobs than it costs currently.

If more people cared to work on empowering things, then more empowering things
would get done, because it would leave less people available to do the work that was
shittier, driving up the cost of shittier work, in an attempt by employers to fill the
positions. Thus as a thought experiment, if more people wanted to plant trees, then
there would be more tree planters in the world, because the price would be lower per
tree planter, and if less high pressure tactic scam salesman wanted to do the job, then
the pay would increase, and there would be less high pressure sales people.

Thus we would live in a better world if people cared more specifically about what the
outcome of their labor was, outside themselves.

Never do something you are good at for free

Also making things scalable and make them into kits.

Being close to the money - sales people versus developers

Just like protein turns into muscle easier, muscle is protein the same way that being
sales turns into higher pay for you easier because you generate higher pay for the
company. It makes it easier for them to give you what you yourself are creating,
whereas if you create software instead of money, you are easier to consider a place
for money to go out, instead of place where money comes in. This is because for every
extra layer away from the physical check that gets written, the easier it is to see you
as an expense.

The value of catalysts

Curation and catalyzing is super valuable. Shouldn't other curators and lubricants,

Solution: Treat your potential employees with the same respect you treat your

fluff and bullshit. To highlight the stupidity of it all: Looking for a facilities

When you write a fucking job offer, if no normal human being would use any of the
fucking phrases to describe themselves, that you're "looking" for. Then you're just
disqualifying all the people who are actually qualified. Do you really give a shit about
half these things? If you make your requirements so fantasy based, the only
applicants you will get are those that are more than happy to lie to you, and pretend
they meet these bullshit specs. No honest person feels comfortable applying to such a
fantasy list of bullshit. There might actually be 0 people on the planet that match
these fucking specs. Easy things like, 10 years experience required using a tool that's
only existed for 5. Why do you give a shit how many years someone has worked with
a thing? Does years using a thing actualy point to competency? If I've been bashing
my big toe with a hammer for 10 years, does that make me a master carpenter?

It doesn't matter what you have done, it matters what you can do. Fluffy word laden
bullshit fantasy paragraphs describing humans that don't and really shouldn't exist,
serves 1 and only 1 person. To make your HR person look like they're useful. If you
HR person writes bullshit ads like this, fire them. These types of job postings do more
harm than good.

Why taking risk is asymmetrically good

Double or nothing until you call it even, then bounce

I used to play poker when I was supposed to be studying in school in between
classes. I'd be able to deal standing up while I was walking around and it was a
lot of fun. I had this one friend named T.D. and T.D. would lose a lot. We used to
play very volatile style, and he would owe me a lot of money. He would say
double or nothing, and we would do double or nothing and he would lose,
double or nothing and he would lose. Now he owed me so much money that he
could never pay it back, and since he would never be able to pay me anyway,
why don't I just let him double or nothing until he was even, and then maybe
we can get him to lose an amount he'd be comfortable paying. That's what life
is, because of bankruptcy and because we don't have debtors prisons, and
prisons full of slaves or at least not there because of the slavery. Then if you are
the risk taking type of guy who's willing to double or nothing enough times, all
you need to do to be rich is just to leave off on a fucking double one, because
when you lose you don't go under negative, just file bankruptcy and you go back
to zero. It's an asymmetrical war. You have a call option on the progress of the
world. You take risk, take risk, double or nothing, double or nothing, stop on a
double. If it doesn't work out, you don't go into the negatives, you just go to
fucking zero, because you are able to wipe out your debt like that. People that
are constantly rolling nothings eventually get a double.









Working a job vs owning a business

When you own a business, you help many people. When you work a job, you help one
person, your boss, assuming the company has a single owner. It's kind of like that.

You'll get more from serving others than you could ever get serving yourself

The sooner you start helping everyone else get what they want, the sooner you can
hire a team of people who focus solely on making your life better, so you don't have
to. New computers coming out? They migrate you. New restaurant opening, you're
already there on opening night, because their job is to spend 40 hours a week making
your life awesome. The sooner you can benefit others at scale, the sooner you can
reflect that scale back to yourself, and have multiple people doing fulltime, what you
could never have the time, inclination, or perhaps ability to do for yourself.


Choose

Everyone else is what matters

It's easy to think that what makes a man rich is what he does. In fact, what makes a
man rich is what everyone else does. Bill Gates isn't wealthy because he started a
business, he's wealthy because the entire world bought his products. It is the world
and it's systematic behavior that causes things to happen. This way you can
understand better that a different human Bill Gates would have emerged having
performed the same task perhaps at a different time. There has to be some merit in


shifting the focal point externally. I know it accounts for monopoly. If you read Peter
Thiel want the least possible let competitor and that more an idea about what other


people are doing than a nice about what you are doing. Xx whaaat this sentence
mean?


If the government doesn't enforce your contracts, or keep people from stealing your
ideas and customers and goods, what do you have? Only through a group communal
enforcement of goods is commerce possible. It's the system of other people that
allows you to do whatever business it is you wish, more so than it is your raw desire.
Hell, you're probably already copying and using the same ideas and principles that
have existed for thousands of years. Let's give society and the system the respect it's
easy to forget is deserved in the nice first world. If you were to try and operate a
business in the 3rd world, you'd quickly long for a real court and real police.

You have to put things in the right perspective. Look at the whole world. Take a
random person, and you give them a million or you take away a million. His quality of
life in regards to his longevity, his health, his enjoyment of life, it won't be greatly
affected. But if some huge breakthrough comes that cures a disease he would get, or
if some new popular thing comes along that brings great joy to his life, the things that
may or may not make that person's life enjoyable or longer or healthier have much
more to do with things outside of his control, whether he has that million dollars or
not, than it would inside his control, as though his million could really affect it. It's like
the Tesla car. It's the safest car, it's the fastest car, and whether you had a million
dollars or not, you couldn't buy one until a guy with a couple hundred million dollars
put his money on the line to invent it, build it, make it available, allow you to be aware
of it. And so, I think that if you're truly globally conscious, you'll minimize the degree
to which you think your money is going to make a huge effect in your life, and
maximize the degree to which everyone else's productivity, will.

What should you focus on?









Focus on something that someone else actually gives a shit about that you can solve a
problem for them. Study marketing tactics, a lot of people got to choose price points,
maybe in this industry one price point beats another price point. Study color scheme,
what color scheme should your website be? Does orange actually make people more
hungry? Does hunger actually sell more of your product? Study timing, study cross
sales, study up-sales, study something that can exponentially grow so that you can
solve somebody's problem financially. Don't study things on the cost side that you
can't get exponential growth out of. "Oh, I reduced your costs to zero. A linear
benefit. Please let me get a little bit of money, please sir?" And then, it's not
applicable across industries usually. "Oh, I found you a way to make this product
without using this chemical so now you save some money." - "Okay. Well, great. What
does that got to do with selling tea in China? Not a fucking thing."

Products are usually better than services
Goods and services are all that matter

If goods and services how we measure the productive output of the world, then
you only have 2 choices for making honest money in this world. If you start out
as most of us do in this world, then you have to work for a living. If your choices
are to perform services or make or sell products, I strongly suggest you go the
products route.

Products are better than services

A lot better. When you sell the hours of your life for money, you never find
more hours to sell. You can also never increase your product range. You only
have the hours you have. The best you can do is improve the market into which
you sell your service, the hours of your life. This is called getting a new job, and
finding a new boss to pay you.

With products you can expand your product range, expand your sales into other
states and countries, get better prices, have special offers, package it better,
offer it with other things, cross sell, upsell, cobrand, private label, on and on and
on.

And you have a brand now, that has value of its own. You not only have a
future, and options, you can also make 10 time more sales every year, for quite
a few years. Now let’s say you start a service "business” now you're relying the
most unreliable thing you're likely to find. Teach your first apprentice? Great!
Now you have your first competitor. You want to serve 10 times more
customers in a year? Easy to sell 10 times more boxes, quite hard to do 10
times more house calls.

Brainstorming and motivation

If you want help doing something, you need only dream what tickles your fancy. I'm
driven by curiosity, like many, and thus if I'm curious about something, it creates a
drive in me not easily overcome. Let's say that you thought about a cool new idea that
would solve a problem you have, and you decided that you would go forth and solve
this problem and execute that cool idea you had. Then you remembered one of the
tenets of a Scivivalist, which is if you work hard to solve a problem for yourself, and




that problem isn't well solved for other people, then you should take the time
required, in this every smaller and more niche available and crowdfunded world to
solve that problem for others. Now you not only get to enjoy the solved problem for
yourself, you also get to enjoy the profit and prestige that comes from making others'
lives better.

The curiosity dries up

Here is where you might run into a problem. Imagine now that the problem you
had was well solved by the idea you executed. Now the original drive and
curiosity is gone. If you want to remain engaged with the project, you must find
a new drive and curiosity. What is it about the project you just finished for
yourself that would make you interested in solving it for other people? Well,
what cool thing could you do with the prestige or money that would come from
solving the problem for others?

Finding the new drive

Perhaps by getting everyone else's capital committed you could solve the
problem even better, with a better material, better rounded edges, a better feel
or sound, I'm not sure exactly what you have in your mind. Nevertheless, the
idea is the same; whatever you solved once for yourself, you could probably
solve again for yourself in a better way if you had 100 times the money
available, and why wouldn't you have 100 times the money available, for surely
you could find over 100 other people in the world with the same problem?
Manifesting reality

Try this for fun. Take something that you want, anything, and plop it in your
mind. Bloop! There it is, the thing of your desire, sitting on a well-lit white
stage in your mind's eye. Now let's dream this dream backwards. How did what
you want get there to that stage? Ok, and what came before that, and before
that, and before that, until you get to where you are right now, sitting down,
reading these fine words. We've dreamt a very rough path that is possible for
what you want to become reality. The challenge is that it just takes so damn
long, and so much effort. Unless perhaps what you dreamt was a sandwich, in
which case, hit the refrigerator and quench your desire at once :)

That last part is quite common, knowing your outcome, visualizing your destiny,
dreaming the future, all that jazz, that's been common knowledge for quite a
long time. This part is new. 1. We looked at steps on the way to what you
want, for they're obviously just as important. You will not get where you want
to go without hitting some waypoints along the way. Teleportation isn't going to
happen. So going backwards and visualizing those way points is super
important, for it enhances the chance that you will reach the first of them, and
then the next, and the next, and so on.

So we did some backwards waypointing. Cool. What other awesome thing
could we do? A creativity exercise I may have invented. Let's imagine as well as
we can, that whatever you dreamt, it instantly became true, for giggles. And so
as to not go off the rails into not doable la-la land, lets stick to dreaming things
instantly coming true just in the direction of that think that's sitting on that well-
lit stage in your mind.



Delicious Details

Here we go, I'm going to give it a try forward, because this one has been
in my mind for a while already, so it's a little easier for me to go forward
than backward. Nah, I’ll take my own advice and go backwards. It’s
obviously what’s missing, and I just tried to dodge out of my own exercise
Damn you mastery! On my stage I see my website. Back in the old days I
might have dreamt it as a building, but how many people can you

GIGAFACTORY xx(dated)

At the top of my website is a beautiful call to action, a headline,
something that the people visiting would actually care to hear and read
about. It could be funny, it could be true, or both. I want my website to
have none of the time wasting meaningless dribble and bullshit that
consumes so many other websites that are much more concerned with
themselves, than you, the customer. It is my belief that the highest and
best use of a website is to serve their visitor. So how is this website going
to serve its visitors? In this instance, it is to share with them a very unique
product that has never been for sale before and solves a few problems.
Let’s just go over a list of the problems it solves before we choose the
language we will use to encapsulate the solutions. We must visit the
negative frame to invert it, and focus on the positive. It’s actually also
useful to use positive and negative space, as it is to use rewards and
punishments, there’s really no reason to limit yourself to just pulling or
pushing when you can do both. (Yes, I know, sometimes negative space
poisons the experience, so let’s try to have someone else lose those cool
points, while we keep the good ones, if possible, it’s art;))

Problems solved: Our phones, computers, and electrical gadgets have
never been more important to us. (I’m hitting Google trends to see
whether the word computer is better than laptop or notebook, because I
want people to identify with the importance of the problem, by listing the
devices they actually care about.)

from the wall, into devices you love?

It’s much easier to dream of a nice ass future when you see other people

Well, at least more viable than any other known way, might still be

Make scalable things into kits




Make things scalable, make them into kits. Little problems that you spend lots of time
on, like my custom car, end up taking just as much time and failing much harder than
almost anything having to do with business, so just do the business and buy a better
car.

Location

Low risk but low potential
High potential but high risk
Tactics
Test

Cheaply and quickly testing if your business will work

You should try advertising whatever you plan to , without actually stocking it, you can
say that you just sold out, or you can say that you were just testing. If you can't get
people to call the ad? Whats the use of having the product at all?

Ramp up

Focus on creating a design that human resources can advance without you

You don't have to be hard on yourself because you don't actually matter. What matters is
the design. If you've got enough money to get a head start set the right design, have the
right human resources. You could do a terrible job and waste your life away, but the thing
you create will do a great job and perhaps those people that you hired and that you control,
they're going to do a great job no matter what you do. Even despite yourself, no matter how
bad you fuck things up, they're still going to do good work because there's people out there
that just exist that way, with or without Adderall, some people just kick ass because it's
what they do.

Startups

"Startup" as a misnomer, a useless description of companies.

I hate the term "startup". If you are going to use words to describe things so that you know
the difference between one thing and another thing, which is why everything doesn't have
the same name, then you might as well stop calling businesses startups. This is because the
important component of the endeavor is what they are out to do, not how old they are.

That would be like calling McDonald's "that 50 year old company". No one cares how old or
not old your company is, we give a fuck what you are doing. Let's stop calling all damn
startups, startups. Let's refer to them as to what they are actually trying to do, and stop
focusing on their age. Or maybe, if you wanted to, I guess you could use their user account
or some other metric that is actually useful. I don't think there's a whole shit load of
similarity between a company that's got a hundred thousand customers that's only 6
months old being called a startup, and some dumb idea that you had in your basement
selling lemonade in your front yard in a cardboard stand also a startup. I think calling both of
those things the same thing kind of breaks the usefulness long term, which was not useful to
start with.

When you start a start-up, there's a very good chance that you're not going to make a
positive impact in the world - because you're going to run out of money.

Lots of people come up to me and they say, "Hey Richard, you know I've got a really great
idea, but I'm afraid to tell it to you because I'm afraid that, you know, you might do it." And
then I say, as Seth Godden does and, you know, lots of other respected authors in the
business world say that ideas are actually quite affordable. As a matter of fact, ideas are just



about the least costly part of any business. You'll see lots and lots of great businesses with
great ideas fail because in fact the hard and expensive part that cuts the wheat from the
chaff.


In addition, some of the best products that you'll find in the world that are well executed
were not what they started out as. For instance, Flickr was originally a video game company.
They accidentally became a photo sharing company, a photo sharing company. Facebook
was meant to be just a way for people to get a cool address at the college they were at,
Harvard. Xx I thought it was so that people in the same year could get to know each other?

From Wikipedia: "Facebook is a social networking service launched in February 4, 2004. It
was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University
student Eduardo Saverin. The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to
Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League,
and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States, corporations, and by
September 2006, to everyone of age 13 and older with a valid email address"

They wanted people to be able to get an address there, and they thought that that was their
value preposition. Hey, look, you know, your friends will kind of think that you're, you know,
at this college. And then it turned out that no one cared about that, and they cared about all
these other things more. Slack, a multibillion dollar company, became a chat and
collaboration app, but originally they were supposed to be something entirely different.

I can't remember right now, but they just built that app in-house to manage the stuff they
were doing. And 37 Signals I believe started the same way. They just needed something in-
house and they did what they needed. That story has happened over and over and over
again where execution is so good that the idea you didn't have is what makes you all your
money, all your success and makes everyone happy and gets you all the clients. The thing
you weren't thinking of, the thing that you thought sucked, the side thing, and the thing that
you thought was awesome, the thing that you got funding for, the thing that you worked so
hard for failed like shit. Only because you were able to execute great on this other idea you
didn't have are you able to make billions of dollars.

Lowering costs/prices/advertisers that anger
Cut out the middlemen

Visualizing middleman scum

Two men and a girl at a table. I introduced you guys, so I'm going to need you
both to have sex with me 10 percent of the time you have sex with each other,
because I helped the deal happen.

Facebook

Dad, son, Facebook. Son tells Facebook, come see my soccer match.
Facebook tells dad. They're all at the same table. Dad then tells Facebook
"ok", then Facebook tells son "ok", and also mentions that he might want
to buy some soccer shoes. This is the world we live in.

Scale

Scaling is easier when code does the work for you.

Part of the reason that doing a software business is so much better than any hardware
business, if effective, is because the amount of good that you can do for others isn't
restricted by them having to buy, have shipped, store, perhaps charge a physical



thing. Their life can be affected in a beneficial way at nearly zero cost per extra user.
That's why if you can find ways to help people digitally, or through information, it's
much easier to help more people.

It's easier to make money by affecting millions of people a little bit, than a few people
a whole lot. IT's basically the limiting factor of how much really can you positively
affect someone's life? Even if you meant the whole world to a person, how could that
person's whole world possibly compare in value to a little less but from 1 billion
people. No matter how much you could do for a single person, you'd find it hard to
not make more of an impact no matter how small times 1 billion.

Suck < Profit

Leave the suck outside, just bring in the profit. Try to do the things that are worth doing and
not all the things you could do, but aren't really worth much. The 80/20 rule makes it so that
80 percent of your problems come from 20 percent of your customers, and 80 percent of
your profit comes from 20 percent of your products, etc etc, so by focusing on the good
stuff, and getting rid of the bad, you can do great things.

Chew and swallow before you take your next bite

Imagine that you start 100 businesses, and you spend all your time shopping for 100
locations for them to exist, and building 100 logos, etc. It's likely you will end up with 0
businesses. Ok, now let's imagine you just start one business, do whatever you need to do
to get it up and running, and doing well, and then you go on to business two. It's much
smarter to start a thing and finish the thing so that it can be making you money in the
background while you start the next thing, than it is to half start 10 things, and watch all of
them fail. Or really even worse, they never fail, because you think that they are all in
progress, while in reality, they're all just going to fail. Ten chefs going into the kitchen and
blowing hot air on a steak isn't going to do as well a job cooking it as one chef putting it on
the grill.

Let your customer know you love him

Your customer sales processor should be more like a red carpet than a funnel, because red
carpet is affordable these days right?

""the bell curve" author says if you can only have one piece of data on a new
hire, this is the best data to have"
lOx is misleading, its often all or nothing.

The myth of the lOx developer

Somethings are so hard that you can either do them, or not, you can't half
do them. This is where lOx developers actually exist. Some things are
incremental, like data entry. Its very hard to find someone that can speak



or type 10 times faster than someone else. Thus, sometimes lOx
developers seem to exist, because they can do the thing that others can't,
0 or 1, binary. And sometimes that same developer isn't lOx at all,
because what he is working on doesn't support the complexity required to
stop others from performing, and thus allowing him to achieve his lOx
status. Thus, if it's not complex, you're not going to have lOx. If it is
complex, some people will never be able to do it at all, and in that case,
they're really infinite x developers because that's the difference between
something existing and not right? For instance, lets say you need to
bench press 500 lbs. Well, you either can, or you can't, there's really no
half way doing it right? So is it fair to say that the person that can bench
500 lbs is lOx the person that can bench only 50? Nope, not if you only
care about the 500 lb. Its binary. The 50 lb bench guy isn't useful for this
task.

Summary: lOx is misleading, its often all or nothing. Complexity allows
lOx to exist sometimes. It is the thing being worked on that decides
whether you can be a lOx performer or not. Before you look for a lOx
person, ask, is this a thing that actually can be lOx'd?

Humans are way less reliable than machines.

To sell more boxes, you need barely any new infrastructure. Maybe more space,
maybe more shelves. You want to do 10 times more house calls, or service of
whatever sort? You need about 10 times the people, and 10 times the vehicles. And

Great, now you've got lots of people that work for you. They get sick, they steal, they
compete against you, they make a union to get the most pay out of you possible.

They don't aim when they pee. Depending on where you live, you might not be
allowed to fire them. They might get pregnant and leave, and you can pay them for
the next year while they take care of their newborn. Lucky you!

If business doesn't go so well and you can't keep everyone, you have to let some go,
you're terrible. You find people that will do the same or better work for the same or
less money, and you want to switch to them? DAMN YOU! How dare you allow
competition!

Being an employer is not all that it's cracked up to be. And it's worse than that. You
will feel great stress as a nice employer, feeling it's your lot in life never fire anyway,
and never give anyone a pay cut. And that social stress of being responsible for so
many friendly faces, should be more stress than any purely financial stress should be.
For money rarely calls you a bastard to your face, or behind your back. Money also
rarely punches you in the face.

how many make services? Xx

Every sentence is so full of fail, that it's like picking out

Job ads are not "looking for their next growth challenge."
They're looking for paychecks. Might you mention a single
thing they would actually care about?

Are your chairs comfortable? What real humans would they
be working with in the office? What do you pay? The
friction introduced by neither party throwing a pay number
out there, far cancels out whatever negotiating power you
think you're getting.

Imagine if you treated your customer facing ads the same
way you did this job ad: You are user, come spend time on
our app so we can make money. You will drive up our
minutes on site. You will make your friends use our app.
You will be our customer now. This poor form, that you
would never do to a user, you're doing to the people you
hope to work alongside in the real world? Speak to their
needs first, then yours...

Well if everything can be an example or a warning, I award
you: best example...of a warning! Please Learn 2 English

someone feel free to paste the original text here.

It's probably poor form to make fun of an ad for a company

about. You are writing the job listing for them...aren't you?

Just like you're not always doing what you should do, I assure you, neither are your
employees, if you happen to be in the tech business, and you have the bandwidth, you
might find it useful to just screen share their screens on your screen. If you have a 4k
screen you can look at 4 full resolution 192x1080 screens. You can probably detect
them fucking off at a compress resolution, depending on how large an area their
fucking off is taking up.

You could also use a program like ManicTime to track what files, websites, and
programs they're actually spending time on.

If you have enough employees, eyefucking them should be a full time job, unless it's a
hard to measure thing, like software, in wish case you may not be able to detect good
things, but you could detect bad things, like Facebook, or reddit.

Management

Minimum management

When you don’t have to manage other people, you don't think work is getting done
when you're not doing it. You're more likely to start doing shit once you lose your
employees, because your fucking around becomes infinitely more obvious. When you
are "busy" managing other people, you're not personally doing shit to get the project
done. It's even likely that the increase in performance you get out of the other people
by managing them is less than you would just letting them suck and working along
side them. This ratio changes the more people you are able to influence. The smaller
the team, the more you should just work hard and let them fuck up.

How to run a business

More money less risk. Better environment, more opportunities

How important is money? The compounding effect. If you live in a better
neighborhood, you have better friends and you're more likely to make more money. If
you make more money, you can have better healthcare and a car that avoids getting
into accidents with other people. Go on YouTube and search for the "Tesla auto
collision avoidance system" or other manufacturers, you'll see accidents that
definitely would have happened, didn't, because they had enough money to have an
anti-collision system in their car, and if you don't have the money for that, then you
are going to have more risk in your life.



The more money you have, the more time you have. The healthier you could be, the
healthier you can eat, and the smarter your friends are, the more opportunities that
show up. Where some people will die by getting the wrong treatment, you'll get the
right treatment, and where some people will die by getting into a car accident, you
don't have to because your car can save you. As a matter of fact, you could have so
much money that you don't have to drive anymore. Or you could ride in a bus that's
so goddamn big that the world could run into you and you wouldn't notice, because
the momentum of your vehicle causes everyone else to die instead of you.

Penny Wise & Pound foolish. Tactics vs Strategy

Just as hard and just as long to make a billion dollar business as a million dollar
business, it's also the reason why I hate retail ones.

Family business

Lot's of people grow up working for the family business. I imagine lots of them get
paid hourly, I know I did. Paying your family members to work seems to be alright.
Empowering employees... Or not

The chance that you have a business where your employees can actually grow is
pretty slim. More likely they'll just leave you when they can.

Negotiating

What is the least you'll take? (buying something). What would have to happen to
convince you of this? If you can't get a good pre-question answer, you won't get a
good real question answer. If you can't hold hands with the girl, you can't kiss the girl.
If you can't get into a conversation with the girl, you can't hold hands.

Hoop theory: two small hoops, one large hoop. This is like the Benjamin Franklin
strategy that if a person does one thing for you, it's easier to get them to do more
things for you. "What's the least you will take?"

If I do X, Y, and Z, will you do M right now? No commitment, then you don't do X,Y, or
Z. If I can get you a discount on this model, and get you the red color, will you buy the
car right now? If I pay you cash, and buy right now, can I get a 20 percent discount? If
they fail the pre-test hoop, then you haven't just given away margin for nothing. It's
like security at the credit card company.

They don't care what you have, they just want you to have more, they want to feel
like they broke your balls a bit to prove who you are. So any information you
volunteer without them asking is just wasting the finite amount of data you have to
offer, and wasting time. Hell, you're probably fucking up their script as well. Lots of
lower paid people don't work so well off-script.

Professional (this should be its own book)

Mission (Why)

Outstanding Personnel (The Who)

You

Leadership

There are a lot of people in this world that have employees, and they
haven't learned to lead through example and those guys can fuck
themselves. They're paying a great privilege to have employees and



instead of becoming better men themselves and getting more
performance out of their employees, they're shittier men themselves. And
so, not only do they get less from their own weak performance because
they don't feel obligated to perform and lead, be honorable and
respected through positive behavior and output, and so they lose twice.
They lose once by sucking themselves and they lose the next time by their
employees noticing they suck and doing less for them, whereas the
winner that leads by example and is honorable and brings his A game. He
gets all the benefits from himself, which may exceed what his employees
can generate for him. I guess it depends on how many employees he has
and whether he's using them right. And two, his employees, they're
driven to excellence. I don't think you can find too many examples of
successful teams or successful companies whose leaders are giant douche
bags who have nothing good going for them. Maybe they exist, but
they're probably the exception rather than the rule.

Skills

Certifications

Your network/peer group
Directional Accuracy (The What & Where)

Business

Making a billion dollars with 6 guys is something only software can do.

To know all those things, that's actually specialized knowledge. Unless
you've been trained in it, or are otherwise a very gifted and lucky person,
you probably don't know shit about what makes a good business a good
business. I've told people how to get rich the same exact way that I did.
Everyone that's asked, I've told the same story because it's the best way
that I know and none of them has done it. Ever. One person made the
tiniest bit of effort, and I do mean the tiniest, like a couple hours and
maybe $100 invested and went no further, right?

Even if I gave you an amazing profitable idea with a super high likelihood
of working, you still wouldn't do it. To give you an idea that's much less
likely and I wasn't living proof of, you're super even more likely to not do
it. Not only are your super special, super amazing ideas that you think are
so good and worth so much money probably actually not, because you
don't know what making a lot of money looks like unless you've done it a
couple times or - I don't know. It's - people that are qualified to know the
difference between a good business and a bad business. Just because you
had the idea doesn't mean that shit loads of other intelligent people all
over the planet didn't come up with that same idea and patent it before
you.

If you invented it on your own, it doesn't matter because so did lots of
other people. While we're talking about simultaneous invention, guess
how many times the super important, super awesome eye ball has been
invented in different creatures on completely different paths. Thirty,
forty, fifty times?



It's something that's so important and so useful that if we all died off and
there was nothing left here, but the chance of life occurring again with
near certainty. If earth was similar in environment, then eyes would be
created yet again because they work well.

Idea Profitability

If you want to know how sticky your idea is, you can just look at the
profitability of your idea. The reason some things aren't profitable is
because people don't want them to be. People vote with their dollars. If
your ideas suck or appear to suck, people will let you know by not buying
it. Whereas you might like to dream that the non-profit oriented, more
charitable idea is the better idea, actually what you're doing is you're just
cutting off the voting ability of the people on the other side of the
transaction. If you did charge a price, that price that you're charging is the
ability for people to vote. That's their ballots that they got to tell you
whether what you have is good, or whether what you have sucks.

If you're interested in serving the customer, if you're interested in serving
the world then you should give them the ability to tell you what they think
by buying or not buying you thing. If you don't give them the ability to
vote with their dollars, then you've never truly asked them whether what
you're doing is liable or not. This is because the only liable answer that
you can use to know whether what you're doing is truly valuable to
someone else or not, is to ask them to answer you in cold hard cash.

Hiring

Hire non-attractive if you can, beautiful people suck up the time and consciousness of
everyone near them, either actively trying to become romantic, or actively trying to
not think about it. That's the definition of attaction. It's not a choice. Obviously, if
you're hiring booth girls, or outside sales reps, actors, etc, then you will need to have
some beautiful people on board. If you're working in an office though, its very likely
you will do better with uglier people, at least from a distraction perspective. Now, on
the recruiting angle however, you might have some challenges attracting new talent if
your office looks like a zoo of human oddity.

You could also try hiring all of a single gender, I'm sure that would go over well with
the Social Justice Warriors.

Scan for scalability

I discovered that when you are courting a beautiful woman, the amount of time and
effort that goes into cute text messages, dressing nicely, going out on dates and such
is exactly the same whether that girl is a 10 or a 5 from 1-10. Why not aim for the
10's? It's their job to shoot you down, not yours. Go in there, take your licks like a
man, and try to make it work. As they say, if you shoot for the stars you very well may
hit the moon. The interesting part of this discovery is that it applies to business even
more adeptly than it does to love.

The time and effort that you put into a business that has small growth potentials is
identical to the time you put into a business that has billions of dollars of potential. In
either business you're likely to think about it and pay attention to news regarding it in
your free time, and when you're not in your free time, you'll likely be doing the 8-14



hour days that business people who want to be successful often put in. Why spend
your time in a business with 10 to 1 million times less potential? How can you tell how
much potential your business really has?


A good metric I like to look at is, how many lives can you affect? Is someone else
already doing this for free? For example, let's say that you wanted to create a store to
compete with Walmart. Hmm, how will you out compete them? Better selection?
Better price? I think they work on a 3 percent margin? They have the lowest costs
from their suppliers.

It's really useful to compare the exponential growth side of sales to the linear cost
savings side. One can go up really high and the other can move very far.

Disruption

Disrupt sounds like disruptor in a Star Trek movie. It's not something you do to a
business. When the giant banks came and ate up all the little banks giving you the
maximum risk with the minimum choice, that was disruption. War is disruption.
Disruption isn't a noble goal. It's the difference between change and progress. What
you want is not disruption, but progress.

There are whole business conferences literally called "disrupt" because they love to
see things "disrupted" because they think it's very profitable to be "disruptive" to the
existing companies in a "space" who are making lots of money. First, shareholders in
businesses are a minority of humans, not a majority. The only people who love the
disruption are the people that are in the minority that stand to benefit massively
financially from it, or perhaps anarchists in general.

Change isn't what we need, progress is. Disruption isn't what we need, progress is. If
you consider a massively successful "disruptive" industry like casual gaming on your
phone (which destroys thousands of years of useful human conscious ability every
year) it should be a warning, not an example. Its profit is not a marker of how much
better it has made the world, but of how much life it has wasted. So basically, fuck
disruption. If you focus on disruption, you are taking what already is and inverting it.
You are not inventing what doesn't exist yet. When you use what already exists as a
starting point to calculate the next thing that you will do, then you already have
blinders on that will limit your creativity.

You don't need a better game, you need a way to gamify things that actually help
mankind. You don't need a way to make long distance phone calls cheaper on land
lines, you need to stop having land lines. That type of thinking. I don't like the term
disrupt, I mean hell, hurricanes are disruptive right?

Make your customers' lives easier. Look past the sale.

What common behaviors do your customers have to perform after they buy from
you? Do they have to buy other parts? Do they need installation? Do they have to
track shipments? What about before the sale? Are there special tools they need or
questions that must be answered? Why break their balls? Why force them to
become experts, and know more about the business than you do? Why don't you do
the experimenting and science for them? So few people do this that you can actually
make it your brand.



Unboxing videos?

You spend millions on packaging material and design, but if someone wants to
see an unboxing video, they have to go to some garage video YouTuber. Why
don't you pay for your own professional unboxing videos giant corporation?

Why don't you do your own reviews giant corporation? You see how popular
they are, right? The end users care more about the unboxing and review videos
than any of the sad marketing fluff bullshit on your websites! Stop looking
inwards and get in uptime. Know what your customers should want before they
do. Know more about your product than they do. Do all the post-sale shit for
them, that you're relying on amateurs to do currently. Perhaps in the process
you will even learn more about what you are making and selling, so that your
next version can be better.

You know what your customers have to do when they buy from you, track shipments,
pay customs, you name it. Why don't you pull the tracking data off the shipping
vendor for them, so they don't have to figure out two websites and can just visit
yours. Then you can scrape the data to see if one of your mail carriers is slow or losing
packages, and they have a reason to come to your website more often. If you give
them the tracking number and want them to use it on the shippers website, why
would they come back to your site and see your cool new products? Foot traffic and
eyeballs are valuable.

Affiliate programs in the microscale

Multitier usage of people in markets

Why don't we see more multitier usage of people in markets? Hey, you know
someone that has this, you get an x finder's fee. Hey I'm looking for this, I'll pay
this, and throw you x dollars for the introduction. You could look at it like TCP /
IP syn / ack overhead. It's a low price to pay for finding and being able to
transact on what you are looking for.

Expanding your business up and down

It's easier to build down the stack than it is to build it up, because you're already a
customer of what is below you. You have an engineering and product scope problem
going up the stack, you're not as qualified to know what the customers want up
there.. More at: http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/whv-big-companies-keep-failing-
the-stack-fallacy/

Bidding tactics

You can offer 20 percent over anyone else's offer, and if there's any other action, why
wouldn't they come to you? If the other people's offers are too high, you can just say
so, you're not morally bound to get super screwed. Or you could include the language,
with a reason. I like the language "I'll give you 30 percent over anyone else's highest






real offer." This works for items that you really want, and don't actually cost that
much, however, most other people, for whatever reason just aren't willing to pay that
much for them. I guess you could use this strategy if you have more money than the
average bidder, or you could reduce the amount of the other bids you are willing to
pay. For instance, you might say only 10 percent, and they could still be happy with it.

Why would you ever bid early? Always bid at the last minute.

Store front sign perpendicular to the foot traffic

If you're a storefront, you should have a sign perpendicular to the foot traffic, or else

Stacking failure modes, duals points of failure

You hear people say good things about doing a startup in an industry that's risky, and saying
that it's like leverage, you're getting an option on an option. Those people are retarded.
What you're actually getting is dual points of failure, either which of which drives the other
to zero.

You're not getting an option on an option, you're getting basically something that sucks
times something that sucks. Let's do the math. You just buy stock in an index, so the
underlying thing, it goes up, you win. You buy stock in a company that invests in the thing.
Company goes to zero, you go to zero. The thing that the company is dealing with goes to
zero, you go to zero.

Would you rather have two chances to go to zero that multiply by each other? Either one of
them goes to zero, you're out, or would you rather just have a single failure mode? Stacking
failure modes on top of your idea doesn't give you more leverage, it gives you more failure.

If you want proof of that concept - start-ups in the Bitcoin space versus Bitcoin itself, which
one's doing better? No start-ups are doing even bearably good, and the project itself is
doing fine.

Understanding costs too much

We didn't need to understand how horses worked internally to build the car. You don't need
to understand how cancer works internally to find it and destroy it. The solutions to many
problems are found by not looking or caring about how or why the problem exists, but just
focusing on what you want, and getting that, not focusing on what you don't want. Would
you rather analyze and understand why your room is messy, or would you rather just clean
it?

Not only does it cost too much, it also limits your creativity, putting blinders on you.

Hunt down manufacturers




Dealing with retailers and worrying about their stock is almost nearly always more stupid
than finding the root, the manufacturer, rather than hunting your distributors down. Calling
all them to see which retailers have a thing, then you know you didn't miss any products.
Zero sum games The loser is often the winner in the long run

The markets are where you go to make a small fortune out of a large fortune.

The people that lose in the market get to go back to work, its basically a battle for who
has to work, and who doesn't.

Markets

When you think people are long or short, it can be the other way, because it reversed

we will tune in. Every time someone visits your store, or sees your marketing, if you
don’t have a beautiful face on it, you've missed an opportunity to trigger an easy to

Showing up in searches

Saving and search vocabulary

When you name files, spam them with the words you will be using to find that
file later, or don't be surprised if you never find it again. Do the same for your
ads and when you look for things. Keycap and keycaps and key cap, and key
top, and keyset all give you different results, but what you're looking for is the
same damn thing. Expanding your saving tags and your searching tags. You
larger sites out there, for fucks sake, do this work for your customers. Why do
they have to be thesaurus experts when you can tell that smart shoppers search
common terms one after the other to land at the same ads. This can be done
algorithmically surely. Or by human.

Halo experiences

We live in a world of 4k screens, yet no matter what site I expand on my screen, it still
wants to pretend I'm on a cellphone, pretty much. Just like companies produce halo
and concept products to lend value to all the other products in their lineups, so too
should websites offer a halo experience, which would lend value to all the other
inferior, smaller experiences they offer on mobile sites. I'm trying to spend money on
your sites folks, why do I have to click "next" 40 times, and see only four columns at
once? Why do the search features suck terribly? Why do I have to search four
different regional sites, and beat up on your options to actually see all of what I can
purchase? Amazon's search is so bad that people are actually building their own
external searches to make the experience better xx(perhaps link to that search site
you say on HN)

Marketing and Sales
Sales


In sales you can offer someone a lie that has monetary value to them, you can tell
them that something is the last one you have, when it's really not. You could also say
that the item was priced wrong, and someone will get lightly in trouble if you buy it,
and it will also increase the value of the product in their eyes at the cost of a single lie,
and some reputation, and you could say, your moral soul.

Discounts

You're probably getting screwed

Next time you're offered any kind of discount or bargain you have to assume the
odds are not in your favor, because the person making the bargain or discounts
or offerer's job to get the maximum amount of profitable dollars out of you. And
thus, unless some odd mistake has been made by that person and he will
actually end up getting less dollars - you are going to end up getting screwed.
Secret discount network

I think having a secret discount network that unionized and gave the purchasing
class some type of competition against the price-fixing piece of shit retailer
distribution networks that force retailers to fuck you over with high prices -1
think that the secrets that they keep regarding their costs should be cancelled
out by the secrets that we keep regarding the discounts we give.

Marketing Serpentine

Avoid the marketing serpentine in all stores (they route you like a sheep, a stupid
shopping sheep that shits money).

Self-help business

The self-help industry is you estimating what your future is worth, thinking I'm gonna
help you get there and then paying me a percentage of it up front, while I do nothing
for the good luck that you might happen.

Overpriced Clarity FM

Set up extremely overpriced Clarity FM account to establish value by proxy. Spam
search results on Linkedin to establish value by proxy.

If you set yourself an account as an expert and you put your price high, it makes you
seem cool.

Benefits of Marketing

So is it solvable? Yeah. Should someone solve it, yeah. It shouldn't work for more than
just promoting Bitcoin. But it's easier to do that one because people see financial gain.



Like, put in 0.5% of your holdings, do this marketing campaign, watch the new money
come in, and see your fucking wealth grow. You could even sell into the new money
and make back your $5,000 and roll it again, and roll it again, and roll it again. And
that's how marketing works. Your lifetime value of customer exceeds your cost of
acquisition, and you're rolling in the fucking dough.

Behavior and marketing

Marketing versus you

Conflicts of interest

If you don't pay for it, you're the product, not the customer. Your
consciousness is for sale, and not even to the highest bidder.

Habits and inclinations

If searched for, many of the habits and inclinations we have can probably be
traced to a hardcore marketing campaign.

Patents, fire and forget

How to file a patent, fire and forget, you will spend more time researching if a patent
already exists than paying your fee and letting the examiner do his job, which is to find out if
it already exists, also, the more searching you do, and the more you learn, the more risk you
have because you are legally required to disclose anything you knew about that was
relevant, and the situation could quite easily exist where you disagree on the relevance of a
thing, and now you are legally liable for breaking the law. If you didn't over search, you
wouldn't be breaking the law. Now, there might be some minimum search that is required,
but I haven't looked into it, in which case if such a thing did exist I would suggest you meet
that expectation within a comfortable margin and not exceeded it, unless you are short on
cash.

Selling your business

Selling to greater fools can be better than selling to wizards. The wizards aren't likely to get
a bad deal, so if they want to buy, perhaps you shouldn't be selling

If great investors want to buy your business, perhaps you shouldn't sell.

If warren buffet wants to buy your business, you have to think to yourself, I'm
basically taking the most possibly opposite position on a transaction against a
person who is known to make better decisions in this area, is that really what
you want to do? Perhaps you prefer freedom more than money, maybe, but if
you're selling for the money I'd say that you're better off feeling good about the
trade when the person on the other side of it is an idiot, than when the person
on the other side makes you look like an idiot in comparison. Xx check the
angles on this, and this is a low priority, hard to make actionable for most
people, however the us vs them is nice.

Scams

Intro

The funny thing about being scammed is that if you don't have much money, you can't be
scammed for much money. If you do have lots of money, it's likely that you are able to make
lots of money, and therefore if you are scammed, you can recover and go back to having lots
of money. Scams are kind of self-regulated against being too gigantic to the individuals they
are perpetrated against. There are some pretty tragic non-monetary side effects, like taking
up all of your making money energy trying to recover that which was lost. The
disenchantment with the overall dog-eat- dog nature of many peoples actions and
identities. For some people the self-regulation doesn't count, they lose their life savings in a
single swoop and don't have enough life left in them to be made whole again. People that



kill themselves, people whose families depended on them and they find themselves out in
the streets.

I'd like to say you should focus more on being productive than you should focus on being
not scammed. The useful advice is reversed the older you become, or the one time nature
your current wealth is the result of, perhaps a court settlement, divorce, or sale of a
company you have a non-compete with, or you're just older than you are young. If you
currently have much more than you'd ever be able to make back, definitely focus more on
protecting what you have than trying to grow it.

One day the poor staff will have to do a literal song and dance to get you to buy some new
leggings or whatever the sale of the week is. I'm pretty tired of seeing scams in the inflight
magazine. This week it was a 300 dollar LED light. Really, a piece of plastic with some green
and yellow LEDs in it, 300 dollars. Says it was tested, clinically. There's a star next to the
clinically that says tested on 30 volunteers. Wow. Then you've got all these bracelets with a
magnet in them, 300 dollars. Says it helps you sleep, and feel better, and focus, and
whatever else you need to hear to pay 300 dollars for a 13 dollar item.

It makes you wonder whether misleading advertisements and the money it parts people
with are justified the same way that people justify the lottery. It is quite literally a tax on
people that can't do math, and it ruins literally the lives of nearly all that win it. But stay it
does. Perhaps we feel better thinking that someone was going to part the stupid with their
money, so it mind as well be for a cause that is kind of good.

It's pretty mind boggling, the mental gymnastics people will do to justify evil things which
only profit them. For instance, taking money from people that are too stupid to keep it,
makes them have to work harder, and through their hard work, they likely make the world a
better place. Hell, that's not even very gymnastical. It might actually be accurate. I am sure
there will be edge cases where someone is literally already working to capacity, or wouldn't
be able to afford better production precursors and equipment.

I think in an ideal world, whatever marketing and leverage and incentives you can use to
make the world a better place, will probably make the world a better place. If you playing
the lottery is bad for you, and it's bad for everyone else, then we probably shouldn't be
marketing it with state funds on television. Perhaps an advertisement for eating healthy,
which, if effective, would lead to reductions in health care spending for the state and
increases in happiness and healthiness. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if more fit people lead
to more kids, because fit people are attractive, and attractive causes attraction, which
causes proximity, which causes love and all the nice tricycle motors that go with it.

Most of what is advertised to you is a scam.

In the world of competition for your eyeballs, the people that give you the best deal
can't afford to be seen, and the people that screw you the hardest can afford to pay
for your attention. Hedge funds weren't even allowed to advertise to you until 2013,
but scams have always found a way.

If it reached out to you, more than you reached out to it, then it's more likely to be a
scam, and there's an art to making you think that you reached out, and not they.



There's a fool at every table

and if you don't know who that fool is, then you're the fool. When you're betting or selling,
or even working with other people it really helps to know who the fool is.

Don't get robbed

I think one of the better things that can come out of this digitized world, is better
cooperation. Now if you let someone rob you, you have not only turned them into a bigger
piece of shit, because you offered them such great profit. You also lost money and a friend,
or money and a relationship. Now you have also sent a pointer that anyone else that wants
to make money has that as a behavior that they can do. Its just all around bad.

R420 & QW.420
Getting robbed

Eyes that linger too long, they may have mal-intent (dad robbed, payroll)

Rich people get robbed all the time (story of gaston glock, kidnappings, embezzlement)
get rich quick

Get rich quick to most people actually means, get rich quick, and do little work.

Pyramid schemes

Don't fall for MLM's, or get rich quick schemes, or ponzi schemes, or any of the other stupid
schemes. Buying jewelry and speakers from the backs of trucks and in parking lots, I've done
both of these things. The speakers weren't good, and the gold was fake. Mlm's are the
maximum amnt of middlemen and the minimum amnt of useful employees.

If you've heard of it, but for some reason you can't buy it in any stores, even though it's not
expensive, then you are likely looking at a pyramid scheme, or a niche item. Items that are
affordable and useful, find their way onto shelves in normal stores, just like soap, and bread.
They're not hard to find, and they have the minimum number of middlemen. No one will
spend time convincing you to come to their bread sales hype seminar, to buy your bread
reseller package, because its already an efficient market, all you would be doing is fucking
over the end users, and getting in the middle of them and the manufacturers.

Professionals

Intro

Get the best work done

Good firm doesn't mean good human on your account

If minions do all the work on your account, only minion quality labor will appear.
Why not hire the minion in house, and save the middleman fee his boss is
charging.

Align goals

If they make more money, when you have a problem, they are more likely to
subconsciously, or purposely allow problems to occur for you, that you can pay
them to fix.

Real estate agents

make more money the higher price the house sells for, why would a real estate agent
want to make less on the deal by getting you a better price? So you buy your other
houses from him? How many houses are you buying anyway?
should be useless now.?!?

Lawyers

like business, the more trouble you get in, the more money they make.

Accountants



Their first mission is to cover their ass, then maybe save you money, maybe.

The tragedy of scammers and conmen

Scammers are often charming, intelligent, motivated people. When their victims discover
they have been scammed, they'd like to get their money back if they can. If the inventive
and adventurous scammers spent less time figuring out how new ways to victimize people,
and put their skills towards honest work, both they and their victims would find more profit
in it. The first thing you should care about when hiring someone is their honesty. Then their
ability. If someone that worked with you wanted to steal from you, you prefer they be
ineffective. Thus ethics comes before ability.

Categories

https://en.wikipedia.Org/wiki/Category:Confidence tricks

256.If you want to avoid being scammed, it helps to know what scams look like. And it
helps to see all the advanced fee fraud scams that exist. Religion is one. Uh, this, what
was the fraud you were describing? Gas station - my wife lost her ring here, watch
here, valuable thing here. I have to go. Just give me this small amount and she'll come
back and get it later. Right. Uh, all of those scammy things, they're... the reason I know
about them is because there's a couple websites that just deal in calling out
scamsters, and they've literally categorized all the different kinds of scams.

Someone had to come up with a term for this whole thing of, I'm going to promise you
a lot in the future, just give me this now. I'm going to promise you eternal life, just say
a little bit of prayers. I'm going to promise you eternal life and ecstasy that lasts
forever, just don't eat any pork. Does that seem like a fair deal? Would anyone not
accept that? Right? If that were reality and you get eternal life and you just have to
not eat pork, I would cut pork off the fucking menu. But that's the problem with
advanced fee fraud is that you don't know anyone who's ever gotten the reward. They
never come back and tell you about it. You never see video. You never hear audio
because it never happens. They want you to pay now thinking that you're investing in
your future, but in reality the future you're investing in is theirs and the future you're
sacrificing is your own.

Finding "marks" "dupes"

Sometime what seems stupid is actually pretty smart.

419 scam emails are written retardedly, because they only want retards to respond,
they don't' have time to field timewaster phone calls, they evolved to be worse, to be
better

What people name their businesses tells you more about the person naming it than it does the
actual business.

They tell you more about what the person in charge of the name had in their mindspace
than they tell you anything about the business. If you are at a website that has the word
millionaire in it, you for sure aren't going to be talking to any millionaires. Basically you're
just going to be scammed. Penny stocks, binary options, gold, FX, Ponzis, HYIP, you name it,
419 scams, the bullshit train is long
Churches and Tithing



The hypocrisy of giving money to God, and hoping he invests it for you, and gives you back
more, because, you know, he needs your money.

Church scams are just advance fee fraud

At least the ones that tell you you'll make more money in return if you send them

Don Lapre Suicide in prison

"A grand jury indicted Lapre in June on 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud
and promotional money laundering though his company, "The Greatest Vitamin in the
World."

The company's "customers" spent nearly $51.8 million to sell vitamins and recruit
others to do the same.

But only 5,000 people received about $6.4 million in commission, according to
the U.S. Department of Justice .

Meanwhile, Lapre reaped at least $2.2 million from between 2004 to 2007, the

Investing

Getting rich on low returns takes too long

To get rich is a pretty stupid idea the way its normally suggested. I mean, you literally have
to continually nearly forever never take money out of your account and experience any of
the real world benefits of being rich (by being able to actually spend money on things you
want), and then one day, after your life is nearly over, you finally get to be rich, because you
deprived yourself so long. That's not a good way to get rich at all! Live like a poor person
forever, so you can try to make compounding interest make up for you low rates of return.

I actually saw a guide on how to get rich that you could save money by foraging for food and
hunting. That's a pretty funny suggestion to try and use if you live in a big city, you'd have to
forage in garbage cans.

Business beats speculation

Why would you put 100k into Bitcoin, when you could put 100k into a business that could
capture even more value! If you speculate in Bitcoin you have to wait for it to go up. Let me
phrase this in a way the fuck better way for you. Ready?






If I create a business for 100k, and in the first year it generates 100k of revenue, and nets
30k after costs. I can sell that business for 3 times net easy, no problems at all. Why?
Because there is money out there that desperately needs a home, and if you can pay 99k (3
years of net) and make literally 33 percent a year return on investment, then holy fuck, who
would turn down a 33 percent per year return on investment? Banks offer what? Like 0
percent, or negative percent? Make a business, any business, and you get to make all the
future money that business have never even made yet. I have no idea why the fuck I have
never heard of this principle before, the principle of making future money that doesn't even
exist yet.

You can make 10 years of money in 3 years, easy as fuck. If you look at the multiples that
publicly traded companies are looking at, you could super easily get a 20 times earnings exit.
I feel rather stupid that I don't even know whether the earnings are the net or the gross, I'm
just going to assume net, because I pray they're not giving you 40 time gross, that would be
like 80 years of profit if you didn't grow and sold stuff at a 50 percent margin, otherwise
known as a 100 percent markup. Xx check facts. Hence, you have two options, work and
work, and wait for the business to make the money, and then you have your profit, or, you
can sell it for money that it has never and may never even make, and then go do it again,
and again and again. Yeah so you could literally make 100's of years of business profit in few
years. You can't do that shit speculating.

Investment advice from the best investor who's ever lived

Warren Buffet's instructions in his will

"My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is
essentially identical to certain instructions I've laid out in my will. One bequest
provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife's benefit. (I have to
use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully
distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following
the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple:

Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost
S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) I believe the trust's long-term
results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors -
whether pension funds, institutions or individuals - who employ high-fee
managers."

http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf (2013 berkshire
hathaway annual letter)

Buffet

If warren buffets wealth has closely tracked the value of Berkshire Hathaway,
then anyone in the world with access to the US stock market could have bought
Berkshire Hathaway stock and made exactly the same return on investment as
buffet did without doing any work. That's pretty insane. He made 94% of his
wealth after turning 60

Tickers

BRK-A, IBB, SPY, GLD, AAPL

Berkshire Hathaway, Goddamnit, is insanely good, and recently biotech is even better
Perhaps Berkshire / S&P 500 for anti-volatility and safety, then overage gets put
into IBB.

Take advice from Warren Buffett



Warren Buffett and Sam Walton, they kind of drive old shitty cars and didn't like
wasting money on themselves, and so the thesis is that one lifestyle design is a
different form of excellence than business design. Just because you have more
money that someone else doesn't mean you have better stuff or more time for
a higher quality of life. Three, if that's the case and it's likely that you're going to
get similar performance, then you should probably be careful on how many risks
you're willing to take to get something that doesn't pay what you thought it
paid.

Psychology

If you like to always have increases, and rarely draw downs (great ideal), then your
stock choices should select for not having drawdowns over any period longer than a
couple of your sampling rates. Or hell, even a single sampling rate? It's easy enough to
just set a reference point some time far in the past, and then you're almost always up,
however, I don't know how well that trick works.

Stockpicks

External task list, real-time stock chart biotech vs Apple, Microsoft, Google, Walmart,
S&P 500 and I'm sure I already mentioned it, but Nasdaq biotech index.

Stock Advice

It's rather odd advice to get and to believe that you should only ever buy baskets of
stocks and never an individual stock, which I gotta tell you is pretty good advice from
the richest guy in the world every once in a while. He has given that exact same advice
to his wife written in the will. However, if that were entirely true then those
companies and those investment companies wouldn't have anything to invest in,
because no one would start the very companies that make up these portfolios of
companies, right - and so it's weird that what seems to be fantastic investment advice
is also completely impossible if everyone executed it. So someone has to be the one
that actually runs the damn companies.

Speculation

Long vs short

It's a little bit confusing but this is part of the reason why people like to be long stocks
instead of short stocks, because the short stock can't go below zero but it can keep
going up lOx, lOx - over and over again. I think it's confusing. I'm not sure on the
math.

Entities generating returns

For the sake of knowing, is there any other entity out there trying to generate returns
on investment? Like a fund so to speak, other than the sovereign wealth fund of
Norway that does so with a mission focus. We focus on companies that do this type of
good in the world. I would love to discover those people and find out how they were
able to create and sustain and hopefully get results in this world.

Economics

Global Asset allocation

Would you rather Google have more cash to do things, or that your neighbor Bob can buy
more beer? To some degree it’s better for the world that Bob drinks less beer and some
companies have more money. Now on the whole, the amount of useless crap that gets done
so vastly outpaces the useful stuff, that it it's probably still not a good idea for Bob to have
to pay more taxes, or be deprived the fruits of his labor because some Mega Corp can afford
millions in consulting fees to create or discover the newest loophole du jour.

Trailing indicator



Do you know the story that tells you that your income is the average of your five people you
spend the most time with? That's some correlation-causation bullshit right there. That's a
trailing indicator. Like when your income increases, your friends just change. It's not the
other way around. It's not like your friends changed and then your income changed,
everything doesn't go that direction.

Death and taxes - The stupidity of dying rich

No one knows how the incremental tax rate actually work: http://i.imgur.com/AsJ6Rql.png

As the saying goes, only two things in life are guaranteed, death and taxes. Well, it's not
really true. Ingvar Kamprad started IKEA. He owns most of IKEA through INGKA Holding and
Stichting INGKA Foundation. He took his share of IKEA, put it in a trust, and the trust pays no
taxes, so he basically pays no taxes. Rich people do this all the time. They either move to a
country where there is no tax on worldwide income, or no capital gains tax. The concept
that you'll always pay tax is a little overblown if you are a member of the capital class.

Even if you do pay taxes, you get a 50 percent discount! If you make a million dollars
working a job, you are, depending on country of course, going to pay over 35 percent. If you
make the same million dollars as appreciation on a property or stock that you haven't sold,
you pay 0 percent tax. Yes, you heard it right, 0 percent. You only pay a tax when it gets
sold. And you never have to sell it! You can often take a loan against it, or trade it for
something of like kind. This keeps the amount of tax that you pay at a very low rate
compared to the poor bastards that actually have to work for a living. There is no life, there
is only time. If you save a man's life you have only bought him some time.

Let's say, magically, that you're lucky enough to have property and capital goods that
generate revenue, and therefore have capital gains. Let's say you're lucky enough to be in
that class, or fought your way up to the working class, as I did, and my father did, and his
father before him, and hopefully my son if I'm lucky enough to have one. If you are to fight
your way through the working class to save up enough capital to become a member of the
capital class, you still got to play the game hard, because they're coming for your shit. You
accidentally run into somebody? Accident.

You're civilly guilty, you lose all your money. Your kid allows a friend to sell some drugs out
of your house. Civil forfeiture, you lose your house. You didn't do shit. Your kid's friend did
some shit. Fuck you, you lose your house. You're driving to buy a car. You go to the bank,
you take out the cash, you drive to buy the car, you get pulled over, they see the cash, they
take the cash, they charge you cash for the crime. Now you have to get a lawyer and beg
and plead that that was actually your money, and that your money didn't commit a crime,
so please give it the fuck back to me. Multi-billion dollar business. Multi-billion dollar
business. More money is seized from civil forfeiture and asset seizure in the United States
than is stolen by criminals in robberies.

The likelihood of you getting killed in America by a cop is like five to ten times higher than
you getting killed by a terrorist. The likelihood that your assets get seized by the
government is higher than someone actually robbing you. The old days of the enemy being




the non-government, for some people, it's much more likely the government's coming to
fuck them up. And obviously if you were actually a criminal or actually doing bad shit that
number should increase, if law enforcement's working well.

Even if you're not doing those things, you are more likely to be killed by a cop than a
terrorist, period. There's lots of cops with guns, and lots of interaction, and catalysts to
allow those things to occur, and there's just not enough terrorists to go around. It's a
numbers thing. The intentions are probably a million times worse on the side of a terrorist,
but the numbers are against you.

If you want to defend your assets and you don't want to pay a death tax. You've been taxed
on the shit before. Let's say you worked, made your million, paid your 350, got left over with
650, bought a house. Now you sell the house, now you get taxed again, you get double
taxed. Well that sucks. So what's the trick? The trick is to not own your house. You let a trust
own your house. Then, the trust doesn't die, the trust doesn't pay an estate tax. You
become civilly liable for some bullshit your kids did or for some civil forfeiture or for some
running a person over or whatever the problem is, the trust didn't run anybody over.

That's the reason OJ Simpson could kill a bunch of people, be found civilly liable, financially
liable and live the life of a millionaire, because his trust didn't kill anybody, and his trust has
the money. Then when he dies, his trust will give his kids the money, no estate, no death
tax. Let's imagine that you had a house, and you gave it to one kid, and then that kid gave it
to somebody else, and then that kid gave it to somebody else, government takes a cut every
single time. Now let's imagine you have a trust. Trust lets one person live there, and then
another person, and then another person. No taxes, no fees, no transactional costs. Just
upkeep cost. You need to pay the trustees, and you need to pay to set it up. You also need
to choose a jurisdiction that is run by the rule of law.

Apparently Bermuda's great because that's where all the insurance companies have their
billions of dollars, so it's good enough for them, assuming that the insurance laws that cover
that formation are similar in well covering family trusts. Who knows, maybe there's four or
five kinds of trusts. Well then, you should be as well protected. The magic here is, get out of
the working class and into the capital class, and then get out of the capital class and into the
trust-using, estate planning, get loans against your profits instead of getting dividends-class.

Then, you basically can't have your shit taken from you and you never get taxed, and the
money that you didn't get taxed on grows faster and faster and larger, until the point where
maybe you're in the one percent. You get to help decide who gets to be president, and you
get to help decide foreign policy, and you know, you get to help decide what's on
curriculums in schools, whether girls can get abortions or not, whether fake things that are
called abortion clinics get set up, but they get girls in there and really just show that they
really shouldn't get abortions, like fake abortion clinics.

Well, you can go afford to go create those things now. You can join either side of whatever
insane argument you're on, all types of insane arguments. You know, free speech for Nazis
pisses a lot of people off. You've got to be a pretty advanced thinking person to understand
why that's actually good. If you're not an advanced thinking person, you got to say, "Hey,
these people are saying bad shit, I don't like that shit, let's fuck 'em up however we can.



Let's make it illegal." That's your retaliatory response. "Oh, this guy committed a crime? Kill
him!" And then you realize that that shit's been tried and it didn't work out that well, and
what we have today, with not just killing anyone that commits any offense, is better.

You know, you wouldn't have a chance to understand why it was better unless you had been
aware of the fact the other shit has been tried before. Debtors' prisons have been tried
before, right? Not separating church and state has been tried before. It didn't work out that
great. Not having a representative as a member of a nation, like taxation without
representation, it's not as good, is what the Americans did. That representative democracy
is useful. So, class war; Get out of the working class. Get into the capital class, and then get
out of the capital class, and into the one percenters. Trust funds. Asset planning. Loans
instead of distributions.

Percentages

I guess you could always use percentages, but you’ll find that it’s hard. The only two things
you can think of that you can pay in percentages are taxes and divorces. That's about it. It's
often much better to look at things in flat rate terms, because you can buy and sell things
for flat rate prices.

What really is a percentage anyway? It compares a thing with something that isn't the thing.
Let's say you want to look at how many dollars you made last year at work. Let's say you
made 50,000 dollars and wanted to look at your dollars as some percentage instead. Hmm,
what shall I compare these dollars to? How much I could've made? Or how much I made last
year? And then what can I do with that percentage? I guess I could try to show my boss that
he was under or over paying me based on what other people were reporting their annual
raises were, in percentage terms.

However, if you were going to go to them for that data anyway, wouldn't it have been just
as useful to just use the hardfigure of what they were getting paid now, that you weren't?
Wouldn't that real number figure that would have to come out of the companies' real
number bank account mean more to the person saying yes or no to your request for a raise,
or since we're in fantasy land, a pay cut?

I think percentages can be useful, and I think more often than not, they can be misleading,
xx Reference my section on the unqualified percentage. XYZ did P percent in T time. From
what to what? What was going on before and after T time? Were you delaying sales
bookings, were you taking on debt, were you buying sales at negative profit? Were you
spending two dollars to buy one dollar of sales? That cherry picking of times is a fun one.

I should make a chapter called lying with statistics. Cherry picking the date range, cherry
picking the products, using the...?

Economic Systems & Productivity

In countries that have fluid and liquid and adventurous credit systems, the upside is that
everything goes faster and stronger and better. The downside is that you have miss-
investment and mal-investment into things that you shouldn't have done. It's an art. How
do you maintain people kicking ass and staying at a five percent unemployment rate (which
by the way is amazing)? If you had a family on an island and you tried to get 95% of your
family to kick ass, five out of seven days a week, it wouldn't happen.



It's nearly a miracle that the economic systems of the planet that we're on now are able to
extract such insane productivity out of the work forces, because if the assets that are in the
world were even close to what you could call evenly distributed, lots of people would opt
for more free time. There's a funny saying that if you get a day off work, it's great. If you get
two days off work, it's great. If you have a long weekend, it's great. Three days, Friday,
Saturday, and the Sunday is an off day, that's awesome. But if you have a second off day, if
Tuesday is off, you stop being a human being. You forget how to wake up, you forget how to
shower. You're no longer an effective member of society. You just, on that fourth day, are
like eating chips and watching the game. It's crazy how that's like the tipping point for some
people.

The difference in power between respect and money

Money is what you use to get other people to do things for you, and in return someone that isn't
you will do something for them. Respect and charisma is what you use to get other people to do
things for you, in the hope that you will do something personally for them. In the end they achieve
similar goals in that they motivate the other party to do a thing. In one case the payoff is directly
from you, and in the other it's indirect and through the money that they will give to someone else,
that is very likely not you.

Skills

Bending the physical world to your will

Clear the slate. Choose your state. Starting from the same state every time improves
consistency.

If you want consistent results, you must perform your action from a consistent "base"
your physical and mental focus and environments must be practiced and correct.

Your emotional state, the color of the room, the temperature, and how you use your
body, also, which outcome will profit you most all affect your bias, perception and
performance.

Xx need better analogy, perhaps the aim small shoot small target shooting stuff, or the
basketball pre free-throw setup, or how you hold your arm playing pool. If you listen
to a stereo system, it's very likely that your brain will "think" the sound is coming from
where you are looking. If you are perfectly between the two speakers, and you are
listening to a sound that is supposed to sound like it's in the center of the
"soundstage" if you look up, it kinda sounds like its coming from up there. If you look
down, it kinda sounds like its coming from down there. Thus if you're ever trying to
judge the quality of a sound system, you must make sure to point your head the right
direction, or you'll fuck up your results
Don't train negative

If you shake your head in disappointment when you miss a shot, guess what you will
do when you miss the shot in a non-practice environment. You're more likely to do
the same thing in the real world that you've been unconsciously practicing. Miss shot,
show disappointment. Screw up, show disappointment.

Guess what. Being disappointed and looking down or shaking your head is the
opposite of performance. You can't make a good shot when you're not looking at the
target. Keep your eye on the prize and don't waste time practicing bad behavior,
conscious or unconscious.

TLDR When the shit hits the fan you will perform at the average level of your practice.
You're unlikely to do much better or worse than your average.

Focus on the action, not the outcome.

Revisit it every once in a while to make sure that the process is still the right one you
should be focusing on. Some large companies focus on process to much and lose
track of the reason the process was originally good.



Anyway, if you put your focus into the area where a thing is happening, your brain has all
kinds of mental and physical tricks it will use to get you to get better results in that area. If
you're playing baseball, focus on the ball. If you're bowling, I always did better focusing on
the ball as well, not the pins. I could still make changes while the ball was in my hand, once
it was gone, it wasn't useful.

Xx quotes from me (lots of options here, like "past... but an idea" "shall impact you
soon"

Focus on those things you can interact with, the things you can touch and
influence, and the world will bend to your will. You most focus on the that
which is coming at the expense of what which has passed. The future is rapidly
approaching, and the past is forever out of reach. For the past is, but an idea,
unattainable, and the future is., unavoidable.

Focus

Changing the focus of your mind to get better physical results. Limiting feedback and
focusing on touch.

I hold my typing speed record of 116 WPM on a laggy computer with a Logitech kl20
10 dollar keyboard. Why you might ask? Well, first, it's probably the finest of
instantly cheap keyboards. Good key feel, rather short travel distance, standard key
positioning. Now why is the laggy part important? Well, you would think that on a
laggy keyboard, you would type slower, because it would take longer for you to verify
that what you were typing was coming out correctly, and you would be right, up to a
point, however once the lag is so high, that you realize the complete and utter futility
of even trying to see what's coming out, you can focus all of your mind directionally
on your fingers, and if you're good at typing, you already know when you've made an
error, you don't need the screen to tell you, thus, by cutting out the feedback loop of
the screen and the visual system, and by only maintaining the feedback loop of the
touch system, you have a more pure data stream to focus on , and one that is
perfectly in synch. I also believe that where you put your focus, your body tends to
naturally locate resources. Let me give you an example.

Computing

Sort

Display

Do not use quality settings on your gpu, or cleartype, it will blurr up all your shit. Ask
me how I know, lol.

Mousing

The countour roller mouse pro 2 is pretty great if you do a lot of typing, every second
you're not moving your hands away from the keyboard is a second you can get back to
typing faster.

Internet browsing

Middle click, or Ctrl left click to mass open windows you are interested in. Then they
can load in the background and be ready for you when you want them. This doesn't
work great if your computer runs out of memory though.

Chrome plugins

Tab outliner plugin for chrome!

Ad block
Screen colors

Try out high contrast mode.

Green text on black screen



Black because, why should you be illuminating things that aren't data?

Green because it's the most visible color to your eye.

On oled screens and all other screens that don't’ have a backlight, you pay for every
pixel you illumnate, so why bother lighting up pixels you don't need, burning through
battery, and shortening the life of those pixels.

Writing things

Typing fucking emails and comments and forum posts

Type them locally in your own text editor, or be very angry when backspace takes you
off page and deletes all data, instead of backpacking in your text. Or their form
submit doesn't work. Or you were posting too fast, etc. etc. Anything you generate in
this world whether its text or images or videos, you need to have it backed up, for if it
was important enough for you to spend the time making it, then its important enough
for you to spend the time to make sure it doesn't get accidentally deleted.

Risk management

Backup all that you create.

Accidental deletion

Hitting cut 2x means you actually hit delete on the first thing, unless you pasted
it first, or remembered to ctrl+z a lot. You should install a clipboard manager to
warn you and keep a history of things you've copied.

Perhaps this is a solution

http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/plugins/multi-clipboard.html

Not losing data

All spinning disks need to be in raid.

Raid is not a backup


Focus

Density is friend

If there's a compact view option, use it.

Virtual desktops

If you use an OS which supports multiple "virtual desktops" you could also just put
your distractions on one desktop, and your real work on another, and there would be
little question as to whether you were really working or not.

Xx this is a way long as fuck way of describing the theory behind what should be a
simple tip. Make this smaller. The meta that you used to arrive at this tip is likely not
as useful as just the tip. If you really want to go into explaining why some advice
should be chosen, perhaps you can make that content a paid addition to the book.
You don't want a timeless book to be cluttered with ideas that will be obviously short
lived, such as how to best use YouTube, or hotkeys to control audio. It's barely worth
mentioning now, when the curation and voice reg is the worst it will be future
forward.

Search

Let the computer search for you, don't use your eyes.

Its easier to type what you are looking for, than to try and find it visually searching
around, which is why Ithe programll aunchy or the newer windows , click start
button, type what you want, it appears there are better.



It would be nice to see such a feature to be able to find that tab lost in your sea of
tabs ,if perhaps the tabs outline plugin didn't have the feature (I'm not sure if it does
or not.)

Hidden Google search options

One very powerful, but undocumented, search tool, is the AROUND function. If you
wanted to research Barack Obama's interactions with Australia, you could simply
include both terms in a search, but you'd find thousands of articles in which these two
terms may appear many paragraphs apart, and bear no relation to one another.

But if instead you search "obama" AROUND(IO) "australia" then the first results will
be one in which Obama appears within ten words of Australia. NOTE: for this to work,
both search terms must be in quotes, AROUND must be capitalized, and the number
must be in parentheses.

Knowing how and when to use the minus sign in a search query, i.e. search George
Washington -gwu.edu

Also ~ before a word to search simultaneously for the synonyms of that word.
<number>..<number> to search for a range of numbers. For example, 1..10
(*) as a wildcard in quoted search strings to stand for one or many unknown words.
"The * cat" will return things like The angry cat, the big brown cat...

(+) will ensure that a word is included in every search result, (per u/izerth, google got
rid of the + operator, so now you have to put" around single words or use search
tools->results->verbatim)

Quotes surrounding a phrase will ensure that exact phrase turns up.

filetype: .whatever will make sure URLs have that extension at the end.

inurl: some.words_here will make sure whatever follows shows up in the URL. Good

for refining your search by domain name.

site:sitename.com will return only results from that site

That's all I can remember off the top of my head. So if you search for "lincoln park -
square -oak" you have narrowed the search in a very useful way.

Quiet vs loud Keyboards (xx probably get cut)

Loud keyboard could make you want to work more. If you work with others though, they
might want to kill you. The quiet that comes from the people around you having well
silences keyboards leaves a nice acoustic background for you to place the sounds you enjoy
hearing the most. If you love the clack of keys, and you're not working with too many
people at the same time, you could very well enjoy the sound of the board itself.

I think music is pretty great, so I prefer a low noise floor. The higher the noise floor, the
louder I have to go to get the signal to noise ratio I enjoy, and at some point you can hurt
your ears, or piss off your neighbors.

Isolation is your friend.

Exclusivity

Power is when you can take the elevator into a department store's special floor, swing your Black
Card and get free premium quality cappuccino that people without the Black Card can't even buy
because they don't accept money there. They don't accept money. All they accept is power. Power
is currency. Power is exclusivity.

You're likely to meet other people there who are already powerful. Power is proximity and
proximity is power. Your proximity to other powerful people amplifies your power. Money is not
power, knowledge is not power. Power is power.

power = mass * time * speed

Power is unused time, potentiality. When you have more things under your control for a long time
going faster and faster, power increases.

Power has carry-on effects. If you're not included, you are not enjoying those effects. Power
multiplies force. You've got to have force to multiply.

In the words of D-Block:

"First you get the money.

Then you get the muthafuckin, power.

After you get the fuckin' power muthafuckas will respect you."

Who gets to decide?

The guy that pays you decides what you do with your time.

If you're a boss, your boss is the customer.

If you're not a boss, your boss is the boss.

If you're a criminal, your boss is the police.

Having the right equipment is a force multiplier that allows you to do things.



Force multipliers are what power is.

Money is not power, knowledge is not power. Power is Power!

Having the money to buy a thing is one part, if it's something that money can buy. Knowing where
to spend the money is another part. Getting them to actually deliver what was advertised is
another. Getting it done on time, yet another still. And then after all that, finding out that thing
you wanted wasn't actually the thing you should have wanted, is a great way to explain how just
being able to afford something isn't enough.

Hell, do you even have a complete list of all the things that are for sale that you should or
shouldn't want, and how often does that list get updated in comparison to the update and release
cycle of improvements, innovations and new product categories? Spending your money wisely to
maximize happiness is more than a full-time job, even if you are so lucky enough to be able to
afford the things you want.

You're going to the same store as everybody else, but you're drinking for free. The coffee place in
the Stockmann department store in Helsinki. Nobody else can even drink coffee there. Only the
powerful can. Others are excluded.

Navigation

Streets and highways

Did you know that streets and boulevards and even numbered highways go east-west and
avenues and odd numbered highways go north-south?

Did you know that cities have an origin address, usually where the city was first founded. All
the new streets grow out from that position with higher numbered names farther away, and
they're divided into 4; NE, SE, SW, NW. So if you're near the center, you could find two 1st
streets!

Use North, South, East, West. Stop saying left, right, here, there, etc.

Left of something means literally the opposite of what you want it to, if the person you're
speaking to is on the other side of what you're looking at. Your left is his right. It's easier to
say north, south, east or west, or reference another landmark, such as closer to the ocean,
or sunset, because then it doesn't matter what direction he's facing when you talk to him.

Be specific when you guess how long it will take to get somewhere. The specificity will make
you notice when your guesses were wrong, and they'll get better with time. Often getting
ready to go somewhere takes as long as getting there, and people often guess wrong how
long it will take to get ready, or account for the crap that always shows up, like where are
my keys? Oh, I need to get gas, there's traffic, I have to help my kid with xyz thing.

Stop using the word here, no one knows where here, or there is, be specific. Where is here?

Presentation

Success (Tony thinks alot of this might go in mind TN-XX REVIEW)

Attention economy

Mindful of where you spend consciousness. What is consciousness? Check out the spirit section
"Consciousness"

Tune out the rest of the world to turn on yourself

If consciousness is the most important and valuable thing in the entire world, then you
should be mindful of what you spend that consciousness on. If you understand sports, you
get more of that in your life. If you're good at business, then you get more of that in your
life. If you read a lot of news, play a lot of games, then basically foregoing some of the things
that are the rewarding and powerful in the world which are things that multiply/how you



affect other people. To invent, to build, to influence are the things that scale. Think about
the quality of what you're doing, not just the quantity. Is starting another dumb thing what
the world needs? Is taking advantage of people's poor programing attention skills what the
world needs.

If you spend all your time absorbing music which other people created, reading books which
other people created, watching movies which other people created, reading comics which
other people created, watching other people have fun, listening to other people's jokes - it
is very hard to be producing, when you're absorbing. We're not full duplex - you can't really
listen when you're talking, you can't really talk when you're listening, you can't really create
or be an individual or do that thing that only you can do, if you're busy absorbing everyone
else's consciousness and not being your own consciousness.

Now, do you need to start your life absorbing other people's consciousness? Yes, you do.

You just need to learn a language, learn customs, thrive, eat, break bread, make love, enjoy.
You need to do that. Once you've done enough of that, got the low hanging free and got the
Pareto principle 80 percent of the results for 20 percent of the input, you need to switch
gears. You need to give back, you've been a child, you've eaten from your father's hand - it's
time to be a father. It's time to give back. You spoke the language, you use the language,
you read the words - make your own words. You think that there's not a place in this world
that you can have an impact. If you focus your mind, regardless of how fucking retarded you
might think you are, or how retarded you might actually be, with enough focus you can
make an impact.

People get good on what they focus on. The more you're willing to focus on a thing that
particularly other people aren't, the more you'll stand out, the more contribution you'll
make, the more money you'll make, and guess what, people love to do what they're good at
and people get good at what they focus on. You can change what you become by changing
what you absorb. If the world is a light and you're a crystal Swarovski bear, whatever you
look at, that light shines on to you and now, you're that color. If you focus on negative shit,
now you're a negative person. If you focus on positive shit, now you're focused on your
positive person. You will literally become what you focus on. If you focus on why you're not
good enough, you're going to keep on being not good enough. In theory, you'll tend towards
that direction. Tony Robbins says if you focus on the wall, you hit the wall. If you focus on
the road, you get the road. It just makes logical sense, it's tautological. Your brain is
constantly running simulations.

I don't like the term question, so a lot of people, like Tony Robbins, like to use the phrase
internal questions. First of all, that's bullshit. Because people without language, which
human beings didn't have like two hundred thousand years ago, were still doing that 'what
might happen' processing without language. It's obvious that you can do processing without
language. Please don't let remembering be the end, please do not become a shitty version
of an encyclopedia - synthesis is the end. Don't become Google and stop training your kids
to be Google. You just need to be Google long enough to get something in working memory
to create something beautiful. You just need to remember something, a marker, an index.
You need to know how to use Google. If you know how to use Google, you can have a bad
memory for the rest of your life, because the Internet is not going away.



I need to write about choosing what you know. So many people find it useful to not know
things, such as their partner cheating on them.


The consciousness economy, which is kind of a new field of understanding, which I hope to
elaborate upon with how shitty the world is due to bad marketing, and marketing only for things
that are evil and not good. Maybe I should unload the term evil.

A lot of people actually have shit memories. They don't remember to brush their teeth, what day
it is, what time it is, when they last ate, they don't remember birthdays, they don't know what
season it is, sometimes, that's because they don't give a fuck about those things. You can make a
compelling case that they shouldn't give a fuck about those things. Let your iPhone remember
them for you! Your IPhone will wake you up when you need to send someone a happy birthday
text, or gift, or selfie, or whatever that you're sending them, your phone will wake you up. You will
not wake you up. You are a shitty alarm clock. If something that falls out of your circadian rhythm
needs addressed, your brain is not going to do it for you. Your phone will. Let your phone do all
that remedial horse shit. Let your brain do what juices it, what gives it passion, what engages it,
what is at the limit of its understanding. I believe that a lot of people that may seem like idiots
may actually be using all of their bad ass memory powers on shit they actually care about. Give
your brain the best memory gift it will ever receive and start giving a fuck about something.

This reticular activating system that subconsciously decides what you hear and what you don't,
what you see and what you don't, what you focus on and what you don't, why not use it to
empower you? Let's look for what is right in the world, let's look for what is powerful, let's dream
the dream and let's starve out that disempowering and feel bad horse shit of everything that's
wrong, and everything that can't and all the fear and all that, let's drown that out. Let's only look
at that for the minimum amount of time we need to, to invert it to see the solution, to execute
that beautiful solution and never have to think about the old suck. You never have to think about
quitting again when you're not a smoker anymore. You just don't smoke. It's no longer a fight.
When you change your identity, it becomes much easier to execute the behaviors that that
identity has. When you keep an old identity that has try-and-fail as a component of it, it's harder
to do the new thing.

Give yourself the gift of focusing on what you want, not what you don't want. Give your brain the
gift of knowing what you want, so that you get more of it. When you fill your life with what you
want, you'll find out that you don't have space for shit that sucks, because it just doesn't fit. It's
really simple and lots and lots of people have solved it. You just want to think it's complicated and
hard so you don't feel like a bigger asshole. You don't feel more regret. It's like writing a book. Is
writing a book hard? No. It's just like writing an email to a friend. Well, then how come more
people don't do it? I don't know. Somehow it feels like fucking homeward. We need a little bit of a
reward for something that takes hundreds of hours. Maybe someone should solve the reward
problem.

I support people exploring what there is in the world as far as consciousness is concerned, and I
would advocate at least the preemptive execution of all the other tried-and-true awesome.

You may have already heard about scale. We live in middle earth, where we're like one order of
magnitude bigger than the smallest shit and one order smaller than the biggest shit? As fun and
trivial as that is to know about, I'm going to tell you why it's trivial, because if you're good at



understanding how things work in the arenas that you don't live in, you're not good, likely, at the
shit that may actually help you, here in the world you do live in. It's just like people that want to
solve problems they don't have. People that think that when they lift weights, they're going to get
so big they don't fit in their clothes. I have a good idea. Why don't you worry about getting so big
first, which you won't. It isn't happening Then, after that happens, you can work on fixing your
clothes, but don't waste your fucking time fixing a problem that's not yours and probably won't
ever be.

If you're still worrying about the universe and where it's going, that's not your problem. You're
not making a left turn at Mars. You don't have a space ship. Worry about the little blue ball you
live on.

The amount of up-time of thought that people have is greatly dependent on the of habits of
internal focus that go on in their mind. If people are honest and aware when queried as to what it
was they were thinking about, the range of things that people actually spend their time focused,
concentrated and concerned with is so very wide. Some people are thinking about sports, some
people are thinking about gossip. Some people are thinking about family, some about friends and
others about ideas. Dependent upon the amount of time that remains engaged, if you perform
thought-killing activity like gaming or remedial tasks, such as data entry perhaps, then in theory
you actually are less alive. You have had a portion of your consciousness and your ability to
become unique and to grow destroyed. It's reasonable to see some of the outcomes that we see
in this world, where one guy will win nearly 100 percent of the time of fighting against another
guy. One guy will win nearly a 100 percent of the time in a test of mental ability versus another
guy. One guy will know nearly a 100 percent of the time the answer to a question that another
person will not. It is because the amount of available up-time and the application of that up-time
to a goal.

The law of attraction is actually perverse; every moment you spend focusing on what you want
instead of focusing on doing the things that get you it, is a waste of time.

Focus on the real world. If you focus on the real world and not fiction, when you care to disengage
and do screwing around you can screw around better because you'll be wealthier, fitter, and have
better resource material to write and gain enjoyment out of other people's fiction.

If you're wondering if the world is actuallyjust a digital simulation on someone else's
supercomputer, you're worried about someone else's problem. You don't live in that scale, so it
doesn't matter.

Being effective & useful

When you're deciding what to do with your life, like play chess, think about it. If you were alone
on an island, would you play chess with yourself? No. You would build stuff and make your life
better and that's what you should learn to do when you're learning skills, investing in companies
or when you're helping other people do things. You should do things that actually benefit their life
and aren't wasteful time sinking pieces of shit. It is the same reason it's kind of good that
companies fire people, because if a company can get the same job done for the world with less
people, then it's the same thing as you finding a smarter, better, more effective way that takes
less time to get something done, so that you can go do something else with your life. If a company
is just an abstraction, or just a combination of people, then you can kind of treat it like a single
person. If you don't need a person to do a thing, free them! Let them do something useful with



their life instead of trapping them. Not only trapping them, but forcing someone else to pay the
price for them pretending to work.

This is a competitive world with limited resources, and the girl that you want has options. If you're
doing self-improvement for a woman, you can shove that idea that you're enough up your ass,
because you're never what you could be. You're never barely what you should be. So what's the
art? The art is to be the most that you can be, comfortably within reason. Pareto principle, you're
in 80% of your results with 20% of the effort. Eat healthy, most people don't. Be fit, most people
won't.

Learn some game, learn what an attractive looks like, most people won't. Now you've won. Now
you actually are unique, measurably. You can do things other people can't. You can lift weights
they can't, you can make smiles they can't, you've got skills they don't have that take years to
develop. Guess what? Those years you put in, those are the years that put you past everyone else.
If you thought that you've got to start this game and outcompete other people because of your
"uniqueness" that brought you here to the please fix me for money club, you're dreaming a dream
and someone's blowing smoke up your ass. Don't believe the feel good bullshit. There's real work
to be done, there's real excellence to be had, and you don't start with it. You end with it.

Because I've recently been on a gun craze, I went shooting and I want to do better at it. You can
sacrifice depth of knowledge for more effectiveness on whatever level you're on. You do not need
to know how to load your own ammo, load your magazines, clean your own gun, and break down
your own gun or even draw your weapon from your holster. You don't need to know any of those
things in order to be a better target shooter, because the things that make you good at target
shooting have literally nothing in common with any of those other things. Knowing how to use
your breath, knowing how to squeeze the trigger the right way, knowing how to hold the firearm
the right way, understanding how to use your body symmetrically and all the things that go into
being a good shooter have nothing in common with being a good reloader of ammo or a good
tactical draw from the holster without shooting yourself in the leg kind of guy. The statement is
that you need to decide whether you're going to trade depth of knowledge in a bunch of other
levels for excellence in the level that you're at or maybe excellence somewhere else. You can't
have both.

If you dedicate yourself in a direction so hard and immerse yourself so hard in a behavior or an
outcome, you begin to see the whole world through that lens. It affects what you think is
important, it affects what you spend your time on, it affects who you meet, it affects where you
exist and most of your life will be muted, deleted and unseen. You might neglect family
relationships, you might neglect showering, you might neglect knowing about the news or
brushing your teeth or eating. When you are so in a fixed state, addicted, single minded and
focused, there's the risk that you have great personal pain during those rare moments when you
notice that you sacrificed much of what you might want in your life for a different goal, either by
choice or by obsession, either through a healthy decision or by having no choice and having an
addiction.

The important part of being effective on what you're typing is you and your brain, not the tool.
Let's say, you learn how to have a schedule. Everybody's cell phone these days has a calendar on
it, a little alarm clock and reminders and things. How many different scheduling things could you
use? You could use Outlook, you could use Trello, there's all kinds of different things that you can



use to manage your schedule. Are those things what is important? No. What is important is that
you have a list of what you need to do and the times it occurs and alarms necessary. It doesn't
matter whether it's a wrist watch or a pocket watch, it doesn't matter what it is, it's just another
tool. The important thing is that you're using your time the way that you want to use it.

I believe that part of the giant myth of personal development is that if you read a book on how to
manage your time and you finish it, then you think about reading another book. No. How about
you just hope that you were already smart enough to read a good book and you just learn how to
do that one? Realize that whatever gains you might get from switching are going to be very small
as opposed to the gains you would get by having any system over no system.

Why don't you, instead of getting diminishing returns at things that you're already good at,
perhaps allocate what time you want to put into learning and making up for big gaps? For some
people, their big gap is that they're working on the wrong thing. If you're working the wrong thing,
then almost no amount of reading is going to convince you of it. It seems like people don't want to
be convinced externally that what they're doing isn't right. Try and talk someone out of their
religion sometime, give that a try, or try to talking them out of a love interest, they're not
interested in it. I'm not exactly sure the right way to help people that have picked the wrong thing
to do.

They just need to discover it on their own maybe. Maybe there's a line of questions that can be
asked in a Plato style and interrogate of what's learned together, Socrates actually. Ask a bunch of
if-questions that he already knows the answer to and you think you're coming up with new
answers. I've always thought that to be condescending. I don't like it when people ask me a bunch
of questions when I know they already know the answer to, or they just tell me so I don't have to
be manipulated until getting whatever outcome they prefer from our interaction, that extended
time.

In summary, a lot of you guys that have read a lot of self-help stuff, you probably need to stop
reading self-help stuff and do what you already know. If you're doing what you already knew and
actually doing it, you would be living a dream; bragging about how much ass you were kicking,
bragging about how fit you are, how good your relationships were, how happy your prospects
were and how proud you were of your activity. It doesn't take but a couple of YouTube videos to
get to the point where you know what you need to do.

The hard part is getting you to actually do it, and that's the magic. The magic isn't knowledge - the
knowledge has been out there for free, forever and it's only getting slightly better, if at all. Some
of the classic are still classic. If you can't find that advice to execute but you've got tons of
willpower, lucky you, you're going to have a very easy life ahead of you. For everybody else out
there that knows what they need to do and they're not yet doing it, you guys are going to have it a
little bit harder, because intellectual learning and understanding isn't what you need to get where
you want. What you need is a kick in the ass, either self-delivered, externally derived or helping
someone kick you in the ass based upon your request.

A lot of people, they don't want to become evil and that's an absolutely fantastic thing. Therefore,
a lot of people don't want to do things that other evil people do and that's where the problem
occurs. I pose you this question: how can a single man gain great power, wealth, influence,
impact, intellect and positively affect the world unless he does much of the same behaviors that



evil, shittier, mal-intentioned dictators and evil people in the past have done? For you see, the
effectiveness comes not from the evil, the effectiveness comes from the strategy. The strategy can
be used for good or evil.

Who has good marketing? Google. Are they doing good in the world? Yes. Who also had good
marketing? The Nazis in Germany. Did they do good for the world? Most people will tell you, no. Is
having good marketing therefore evil because the Nazis did it? They also cared about animal
rights, cared about people not smoking, built roads, they did a lot of good shit. Unfortunately,
they poisoned in the minds many of these good things because they did so much evil shit. So what
is the point that I'm trying to make?

If you want to make a huge impact in this world, you want to make this world a better place or
you just want to make lots of money or you just want to be loved, you are going to need to do
what works and a lot of what works is what worked for assholes. If the world is lucky enough to
have a good person such as you, use the same tactics and occupy the same receptors sites on the
global consciousness, it's much better that those receptor sites gets filled by the good that you're
doing than by the evil that these assholes are trying to do. If there's a lot of people out there with
podcasts trying to convince you to buy their "get rich quick" bullshit, wouldn't the world be a
better place with your podcast sharing the same ideas but not trying to scam people out of
money.

Avoidance is bad, actually do what you want

My new theory on life is that a lot of people spend a lot of time doing things, not because they
want to do those things, but actually they don't want to do something else. If your marriage sucks,
you would try to spend all your time at work. If you don't want to write a book, you would spend
all your time playing games. Doing whatever else, getting laid etc. Anything else meta work. Work
that seems like work, but it's not, like learning. Learning is not doing. I found that one way to
overcome this is to decide what you want and then go and get what you want. Now, I know it
sounds simplistic and that everyone is already doing that, but they're not. If you think about
something you want, and that's what's clear in your mind, instead of what you don't want, you're
more likely to go do it.

DO! Bypass procrastination by doing what you want

I think greed could be a useful way to beat procrastination. Just decide what you want and then
just do it. Do it leisurely, do it quickly, do it however you want, just get what you want. Don't do
what you don't want. Don't live a life of avoidance doing things only because they're just not some
other thing. This guy Wong that has a flash modifiers that works with Sony (Xx Specify who's
Wong), he thinks you should just not care. I think that only works if your "not caring" ends up
looking behaviorally like someone else's "caring a lot" just whatever weird mindset. Depends
whatever reverse psychology works on you internally.

If someone were truly interested in learning a thing, we have Wikipedia, and it's fun to read. We
have Discovery Channel, it's fun to watch. We have podcasts, they're fun to listen to. If you're
actually interested in something in this world, there's a nearly limitless amount. We have libraries,
free books. There's a nearly limitless amount of information for you to absorb and enjoy in regards
to any topic that you find interesting. If you're truly interested in something, learning something, I
have to say that you're probably not waiting for class to start in the morning. I'm reading The
Republic, and in The Republic they suggest that there's three classes of people in the society, and
then they educate those classes differently. They assign standard timeframes to those education
periods. Why on Earth would you treat all your students on the same time frame? That's quite



stupid. There's some people that are ready to be professors at the age of eighteen. And there's
some people, most, that will never, ever be ready to be professors. How tragic would it be to use
some artificial timing that has nothing to do with the student, and nothing to do with the update
of science, and nothing to do with the update of education tactic?

The reason the Pomodoro technique (Xx Specify what it means) works is because it flips your
brain's desire to hunt things that are scarce, and it makes your time available to do work scarce.
Therefore, your brain tries to hoard it, whereas quite normally you have an overabundance of
work, and therefore you don't get any benefit by just doing it. You lose out on all the other scarce
things you're not doing because of the work.

When you've got some type of mission that's all consuming, that's all you think about and all that
you know that you should think about, and then you finally have found a way, a strategy, a
method to think about that thing, your old habits and your old vices begin to fade away to become
replaced with something more valuable. If you used to be addicted to women, women matter a
lot less. If you used to be addicted to games, games matter a lot less. That's a great unexpected
side effect of focusing on what really matters. All the shit you used to have to try and focus on not
doing, you don't have to focus on not doing, because you don't have time to focus on not doing
them, because you're too busy doing what you love.

Car progress analogy

People are like cars in a race. You can have a very fast car, but pointed in the wrong direction. You
are not going to cross the finish line. Your intellect is the size of your motor. What you focus your
mind on is your fuel. Your goals are your steering wheel. Your suspension is your persistence. Your
tires are how well your goals match what’s possible. Your body is the car’s body, and the more fit
for purpose it is, the less hard you will have to push to your goal. Sometimes if you go too fast, you
will be pulled over by the law, and it will take longer to get where you are going, if you ever get
there at all. Perhaps you crash. Go through common problems people have where they don’t get
where they want to go by missing key parts of a well running car.

Analysis Paralysis

Knowing the real good or bad of a thing in hindsight, the wisdom of crowds and prediction
markets. Should you have kids, how many and when?

How does one make the decision between working harder to make money, then one day spend it
to change the world, versus starting to change the world now and stop making money? There
comes a day when you can’t make up the time you've lost thinking about it instead of taking
massive action. Pick your battles. There is an endless amount of suck. You will always be
presented with conflicting ideas, the question is, which shortcut to action pays better? Sometimes
not delaying is better, sometimes waiting is better.

Achievement

We are all capable of great things, even the worst of us. There always has been and always will be
a few things standing between us and greatness. I will call these the great traps.

Circumstance, lack of opportunity, lack of time, complacency, "it's good enough", lack of
creativity, lack of follow-through, too individualistic, no teamwork, not individualistic enough, no
unique ideas. Greatness that is too small in scale. Learning things that become valueless.

It's pretty inspirational to hear about people that you might think shouldn't have been successful,
but who ended up wildly successful. For instance, Dr. Seuss apparently was going to burn his book
after it got rejected from twenty different publishers. He met his friend on one side of the street



that he was walking on, wouldn't let him burn it. If he hadn't been walking on that side of the
street, he said perhaps he'd be in the dry cleaning business now. You hear the same thing with
Walt Disney. A number of times he tried to get funding for Disney World. You hear things about
really, really old people getting started like Mr. Sanders, Colonel Sanders, who started KFC. I
believe he was in his 50s, and Morgan Freeman who got his first real good acting gig at like 35 or
45, probably 45.

Xx All these things, look them up. Verify them. The point is that if ever life is hard for you and
makes you want to stop, let me tell you, there's a lot of people who have had it a lot worse, and
it's worked out just fine for them when there was no clue that it should have.

The Past Poisoning your future

Let me let you in on the secret on the downsides to believing your own bullshit. Take a guy like the
guy who made Star Wars. The first Star Wars was good, it had many of the elements, themes and
storylines and ark of other successful good stories. Just like Jaws, the movie. It was about a guy
faced with a problem and a journey to solve that problem. The next movie was about the shark,
not the guy. That’s a different fucking movie and personal development, science and music it’s the
same shit.

People become great by doing the things that allowed for that greatness, then once they've
achieved respect, influence, popular opinion, they believe their own bullshit. Stop referencing
things outside themselves, which allowed them to get the effects in the first place. Instead they
change their focus and reference the shit they said internally, then they never grow and then they
never progress.

The whole pool of the universe was the fuel that they used to create their original progress and all
of the excellence that could be copied, found and used from everyone that preceded you that
allowed their original excellence. Now, they feel obligated to honor themselves and up talk
themselves and not prove themselves wrong. If you come up with a new belief system and it's not
identical to your old one to some degree, you were wrong. Just like a giant company that doesn't
want to lose a shit load of sales on their worst product by coming up with a better product, which
will cannibalize those sales. The greatest thinkers and the greatest companies that are having the
most impact fuck themselves over with their greatest enemy, previous success.

A great title for that is the greatness of the past poisoning the future. You see it with musicians,
you see it with thinkers, you see it with scientists. If you haven't produced something smarter,
different, better than what you originally created, you are no longer the person that you used to
be; you are less powerful and less effective. If you're Tony Robbins and you take 15 or 20 years off
from book writing, and the next book that you write isn't version 6 of your original book, where
you got some shit wrong, fixed it and came up with better ways to understand the world, and is
instead a book on how you should give your money to other people that will make you money in a
401K and a fund. That's terrible. That is not a proper development of what could be widely
defended as the most successful success coach. You have failed. If you have stopped producing, if
you have stopped creating, if you have not proven yourself wrong and proven your own ideas, you
drank your own Kool aid, you drank your own bullshit, you rested on your laurels. I don't want to
say you shouldn't be rewarded for it, but the world would be a much better place if you were still
kicking ass as you used to.



For all you guys that don't want to be so hard on the greatest and most productive of us, and you
want to make it okay for them to rest on their laurels and just chill and write out their success, let
me tell you, they're going to pay with that with their lives. They will die more painfully and earlier
than necessary, as will everyone they love and all of their offspring, because they decided to shove
their thumbs up their ass and not perform and not produce. Those were the heroes. Those were
the guys that had the easiest path to make a huge and great impact in this world and they shirked
their responsibility or pretended that they didn't have responsibility to themselves, to their
ancestors, to their offspring, to their loved ones, to their friends, to their culture to their fellow
men, to their future selves, which will harshly disagree with what they did this day.

The fucking off that the greatest of us perform is quite similar to the fucking off that I did for 10
years; traveling the world, trapped in a hotel room playing video games and giving very little back
to the society that allowed me to have that quality of life. Luckily, because I'm curious and I like to
read, I gathered enough knowledge that I can make up for some of that lost time today by
spreading good ideas in the world. Had I not made that transition and stopped that evil, terrible,
destructive, disgusting behavior of wasting the gifts that I've been given and wasting the skills that
I had developed and wasting the opportunity to influence the world in the easiest to influence the
world time that ever existed, the most connected world speaking the most common languages, it
would be a fucking tragedy and I would pay with my life.

Don't worry about outcome, only long enough to create accurate worry about actions towards outcome
Having sex and curing aging are the same thing from the guy's perspective. Guys don't dream
about baby showers and baby clothes on kids, we just dream about fucking. For the same reason
you don't have to dream about making people immortal or never age, you just need to worry
about doing the things that cause that. You don't have to worry about the outcome, you just have
to worry about curing the little parts. You're not trying to create super long living human beings,
you're just trying to cure cancer or heart disease and all the things that kill them. Then, in the end
you're like oh shit, I have a kid.

Punching hard to get the result you need

In physics we have rolling and starting friction. It’s basically a subset of Newtonian motion
whereby an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.
That is why if you're already moving, it's very easy to keep moving, and if you're stopped, it's
harder to start.

More at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s law of triviality
Breaking through starting friction

Using stimulants, like caffeine, might pay the same dividends in uptime-downtime volatility
increasing to break over starting friction costs that having a sleep cycle effect does for animals
that sleep and for CPUs. Xx Revise sentence

This type of logic can also be applied to being in the "zone" if you play sports or have bursts of
creativity. It's also a way to recognize that very often what you need isn't more weak force, but
just a burst of strong force, like getting the breaks to lock up on a car.

It's meaning and belief. I chose to enjoy the suck. I chose to see the pain as a goal. I chose to
embrace the suck and embrace the pain. And want it. I consciously chose that. Now, I'm
conditioning my body to stop fighting, and to be like, "yep, this is what we do now." When we feel
uncomfortable and the suck and horror kicks in, and the compulsion kicks in to read all the
websites, play all the games and fuck all the girls and stop being conscious. Whatever it takes to



stop being conscious. I got to do whatever it takes to stop existing. I got to execute a program so
hard, so fast at such a speed over and over and over again until I can't think anymore, because all
of my thinking is being used

Some people think that they just have to stop doing everything else in their life to be productive
and be useful. We've got a disagreement between two ideas. If you want to make something so it
doesn't need willpower anymore, and so that you amplify the chances that it keeps occurring,
then you need to fight through discomfort and fight through identity issues, and become a person
that does that thing whether it feels good or whether it doesn't, because it's just what you do. It's
easier to do it than it is to not do it. How do you get to that place? You get to that place through
whatever trickery and effort and trying hard that you could possibly think of that allows you to do
it for long enough that it sticks as a habit

Maybe you use motivational posters, self-speech, a coach or a team, or maybe you use drugs, or
maybe you use hypnosis. It doesn't matter what trickery you're using to do what you should do,
but once you've done it long enough, it becomes a habit, and it becomes harder to not do it than
to continue to do it.

Let's talk about that time management. Studies have been done, it's good for you to get eight
hours of sleep. It changes based on your genetics, maybe it changes based on light, location, diet.
Let's call it six to eight hours. 24 hours in a day, eight hours of sleep, leaves you with sixteen
hours. Sixteen hours is just two other eight hour periods, at least one of which most people are
used to working and culturally accepted as working, not including transition time. A nine to five
job is eight a hours a day, but they actually take an hour off for lunch, so it's really only a seven
hour job.

The question is, if you were willing to sacrifice all transition time and every other activity except
sleep, then you have sixteen hours to work with. Most people are used to working eight, and
they're used to taking off Saturdays and Sundays. Your maximum hourly increase is from eight to
sixteen. We'll just exclude transactional costs, like driving and dressing and preparing, we just
want this math to be a little easy.

You can go from the eight hours of productive output that most people have, five out of seven
days, and move it to sixteen hours of productive output, seven days. The math is actually pretty
simple. Sixteen times seven is 112. If you work sixteen hours a day, seven days a week, it is 112
hours of work per week.

The math is 112, seven days a week, at sixteen hours a day, versus 40 hours a week. If you only
slept and had no transitional time at all, you still cannot triple your productive hours. It's not
possible, which is why if you want to be more than three times as effective in the world, you need
other people, or things, or ideas that aren't you, because no matter how much you break your
own balls, you are only worth three times the hours. I can argue that immersion is more valuable,
because hard ideas have start up and spool down time. Or, I can argue that more time is less
valuable, because you burn out, and you get tired of focusing on a thing.

Either way, let's just call it about three times effectiveness based on total sacrifice of any non¬
productive enjoyment. You want to watch a movie? You're not in the movie business? Fuck you.
You want to go outside to eat? Nope! No eating outside. Matter of fact, no getting up from the



chair. No! It's not that great. If you want to really, really make breakthroughs in this world, you've
got to use people that aren't you, because you can only get about three times as many hours.

Now, can you change behavior and do things that are better tactically and strategically? Sure, and
you should, because as I said previously, more hours is only worth a maximum of about three
times. When you look at the people that are ahead of you in this world, three times isn't going to
get you even close, and it almost doesn't matter who you are.

Enduring pain in order to stash up enough energy to make a breakthrough, to then have
overwhelming success is like holding your breath before a dive. Sucks while you're doing it, but it's
the only way you can get low enough and get back with enough oxygen. Take whatever you want
at the bottom of your dive up to the top and enjoy it. During the suck of getting no rewards, or
people telling you what you're doing is stupid is kind of what's required to make the
breakthrough, to get to the place that they would never have the courage to get.

A great example of this is trying to cook a steak by a committee where 10 people come into a
room, look at the steak and blow their warm breath on it trying to cook it. You could increase the
number of people on the committee to 100 and you still wouldn't be reaching the temperature
that you need in order to cook the steak. You need one hot thing, not 100 warm things.

When you want to create an outcome and you've got limited resources, most people choose the
objective based outcome filtering of "what's the critical path?" What's the least number of steps
with the least amount of risk to get from? Where we are now to where we want to be? Then you
look at where you want to be and you say "Well, what do we want?" We want customers and we
want our customers to like us. Do we let our customers develop the product that they will fall in
love with? Yes! What's the minimum viable product to get out the door to start getting feedback
with our case study, to start optimizing the product and make it amazing?

We already have a good product; every money value that we already spend will not only generate
the best return, because it's the most sticky and most useful product, because it's already been
optimized by some pre customer test cases. It's already more reliable because we fuck those guys
around getting it right so now the new guys get it better. It's also because it better enhances the
likelihood that every new customer that we get tells a friend and we might be able to get some
free customers from word to mouth that we didn't have to pay for. Those customers tend to stay
longer.

The problem with that approach, the upside to that approach is that it cuts out a lot of needless
steps that would waste time and energy, and not create a better product for your customer and
not create a better market fit by choosing the right pricing, loading the scope and doing one thing
really well instead of doing ten things shittily. It's very good for those things. That way the lean
startup methodology and critical path analysis are effective in those areas. However, there is a
downside to using critical path analysis and lean startup minimum viable product style of creation.
That is that some of the things that you could have built that may be more profitable than the
original idea is, and you may have easily pivoting into. You never notice because you filtered out
and cut off the other novel and interesting things to focus on the one thing that you decided was
the most important. What you'll find is some of the companies that are wildly successful are wildly
successful with products that were definitely not what they were invented to do.



Flicker was a video game company. Then they turned into a photo company, because people liked
that more. Slack was a video game company and they turned into a product management
company, because people like that more and down the line. When you use novelty search, when
you care about bottom up, when you do what is interesting and perhaps have enough energy to
survive that indeterminate space for longer, then you can end up with unpredicted excellent
rewarded outcomes that you would never have been able to find or figure out from the end point
backwards style.


In summary, by choosing a destination, an outcome and reaping the rewards of not wasting
energy falling down paths that are maybe dead ends, you have a high specificity, you don't get
false positives and you don't waste time. You also have a low sensitivity and you don't capture


mar/( Xx What’s this?) that you might have been able to do, and so it is the path between what


you want, which is really profitability in most cases in business, and where you are, which is an
idea.


My point is, I might be able to create some good things in the world regarding people making
better decisions and taking responsibilities in their own lives. Using an interesting novel search
pattern since human beings are trained to care about that shit more than brute objectivity
anyway. I am trying to optimize the objective likely, minimum viable path to get the thing done,
because I'm so uncertain in the likelihood of that path over the others anyway. I think I should quit
wasting time trying to optimize outcome strategically and with the concrete vision and be happier
with a more arty flowery throw a lot of shit at the wall and see what sticks style. Xx Revise
paragraph, idea vague/hard to understand

If you don’t do it, you don’t know it. If you didn't build it, you didn't invent it. Most of what you
think you have invented, you will find has already been patented by people a long time ago, or
they already tried it and it failed. It's like the human eye. We aren't the only animals with eyes,
they've developed separately and unrelatedly time and time again at least 50 different times
across many different animals, because they serve a very useful purpose. For the same reason
animals developed useful eyes separately, you likely came up with a cool invention to solve a
common problem, just like everyone else did, you just know about the problem and solving it
more than you know about their attempts. For someone who spent more time reading patent
applications they might have the opposite experience.

It's easy to think that what makes a man rich is what he does. In fact, what makes a man rich is what
everyone else does; What the society you operate in allows you to own, what the judges and lawyers
will let you keep and not tax away, what good job your employees do and how much your customers
will buy, and how many people didn't choose to compete with you or do the same job at roughly the
same quality for free. You can't get rich in a vacuum, unless you're in the space exploration business. Or
thermoses.


If you're not doing it, you don't know it.

A lack of balance is the definition of pain.

How do you get people to focus on commonly forgotten ingredients of a successful recipe? What is
more important in a cake? The sugar, the flour or the cooking? You need them all, or you don't get a
cake. By this analogy you can see that a successful person such as Bill Gates isn't wealthy solely because
he started a business. He's wealthy because he started a business AND the entire world bought his




products. You see that it is the world and it's systematic behavior that causes things to happen, then you
can understand better that a different human Bill Gates would have performed the same task perhaps at
a different time. There has to be some merit in shifting the focal point externally. I know it accounts for
monopoly.

If you're a seductionist and you have the normal training, it is very self-centered and not system
oriented, the same way that many self-help and personal development materials are. When you include
your relationship to the system and their relationship to the system, you can save a lot of time when
you're not swimming against the current. Egocentrism is one of the lowest forms of understanding.

Marriage

Prenupts

People that don't have prenuptial agreements. They get divorces. And the reason is if
you give someone a million dollar reward for thinking you're not funny or cool to hang
out with anymore. Let me tell you for a million dollars it's very easy for people to fall
out of love with you, for a million dollars it's very easy for people to think that you're
just not that cool anymore. You could be the funniest guy in the world. And if there's a
million dollars payoff for not laughing at your jokes that million dollars are going to get
paid. Don't structure the underlying agreements and you know mutual beliefs, in a
way where the parties have a reason to have sex.

One should not set a tactic as a goal.

Marriage is buy a way to amplify enjoyment in life. Some marriages are wonderful,
some are deadly. To be clear in ones objectives is to hit the mark much easier. Many
the married person would be better off finding a new person to enjoy marriage with,
than fight desperately to not be in something new.

Thus it's not the staying in a situation that's important, that's but a means to an end.

That being said, flexibility is nice, and if you have more paths to happiness and less
paths to sorrow, you are likely to be happier. Don't sweat the small stuff, and it's all
small stuff the saying goes.

Fashion

Texturize things

Popped collars and spiky hair do for your body a texture that you would look
individually at a material to find. So, popped collar and spiky hair and the three
dimensionality that comes from at scale of a human. Adding a little bit, 5, 8 percent,
extra volume in different directions makes more definable image and sharper edges,
things that are attractive. On the smaller scale, that's what you do to a material to
make it more beautiful, is you, you know, texture it.

Eyebrows

In order to impart emotion, you really have primarily your eyes, eyebrows, mouth, lips
and the angle of your head. This is why eyebrow trimming can be so useful to your
face. It's always expressing your emotions on your behalf.

You get the most bank per inch of hair trimmed here. For a small amount of time and
discomfort, you can have a more open, appealing and emotional look. Hell, maybe



you're lucky and you have a unibrow across the top. You get SUPER bang for the buck
by making two eye brows out of that thing. You'll have to spring for a replacement for
your caveman costume at Halloween though, (this is humor at the cost of the few,
which I'm totally ok with. Xx)

For you gentlemen out there, if you remove too much hair, you're going to first look

The Mona Lisa has no eyebrows, however, she sure as hell does have some dark

Product development beats sales

The winners of the world aren't known for going out there saying the same shit over and
over again to people, optimizing for their response because these people shouldn't be
optimized for. These might not be the best people of the world. You'd much rather be in an
environment where people are preselected to like you because they knew who you really
were, were proud of what you really did and wanted to be around you. Not for your act, not
what you wish you were or not what you convince people what you are, but what you
actually are. The thing that took effort, that didn't have anything to do with them and the
more time you spend on yourself improving the world, improving your impact, the less time
you spend on others. It's the difference between product development and sales.

You could scam someone into buying nearly anything and in the end, you'd be a scammer.
Or, you could build the best product that anyone has ever seen and it would sell itself
without you saying a single word. You could beg them not to buy it and they'll beg you to
pay double because you've built the best product that they could find. That's a choice you
have to make. Do you want the short term success of actually hurting a product? Do you
think going out, staying out late and drinking alcohol, doing silly shit and risking bar fights
and all that, do you think that develops your product? No. As a matter of fact, anyone that
knows that that's what your lifestyle is will look down upon you as someone that is less
valuable, more risky and is a waste of time.

Paid peer group, get face time with Warren Buffet

Clarity.fm, who do you think is going to give you better advice, your buddy Warren from
down the street or someone with good reviews on clarity.fm that charges 15 dollars a
minute? That's 900 dollars an hour. Well, unless all the reviews are fake, it's very likely the
clarity.fm person. Unless of course your neighbor is Warren Buffett.

One strike you're out

If you've got enough lead flow, the one strike policy is an amazing policy.

Looking cool

Do not pull your phone out, it never works
Cool photos? Doesn't work
Funny youtube video? Doesn't work
I've never seen anything on a phone work, ever

Loans

YOU'RE BETTER off re-borrowing money owed to you, than getting it paid back, because
they think they can borrow some more, cause now you owe them, because you borrowed
back money they took from you in the first place
Writing

There's no such thing as writers, only dreamers

The writing is but the means to the end of sharing ones dreams with the world.


Scammers



Is a person who they really say they are? Check their old, real, printed yearbook (that you
got from someone they couldn't get to give you a doctored one)

Finding beautiful people that don't go out (search old yearbooks, where'd they go?)

Advertising is life

Everything I have that is good, is from marketing
First business newspaper ad

2nd business ads to give other people something they can advertise
Lovers, say hello to lots of people I don't know, that's advertising
Friends, say hello to people I don't know

Kids

What's right for the future of the word is often is wrong for us individually

, and what's wrong for the future is right for us from a short term, mid term personal
development. Do you care about money, do you care about excellence in areas that
are not producing kids? If you do, producing kids is going eat up alot of your time, and
yes, it's going to give you fulfillment that you couldn't otherwise get, and yes, mid to
long term it's going to pay off great (hopefully), but it is still a trade.

Sperm can change, eggs can't

Girls are born with all the eggs they'll ever drop. Men make sperm all the time. Thus
it's likely that changing your lifestyle has a larger affect on the man's half of the DNA
donated to the baby than the moms. At best Mom could choose to drop a different
egg, assuming some accurate inventory was kept as to what eggs were where. So
likely if you think the status of your own body in fitness affects the DNA you give your
kids, its probably more important for the man than the woman to have the status they
think will positively influence the baby. Now, after the kids already growing, it's all
mom, dad's pretty much out of the game except for making sure mom has good
nutrition, rest, and mindset. Good luck with that...dads!

Dna tests are data verification

Getting a dna test on your kid is like making sure your data doesn't have bitrot, you're
literally checking the data in the kid to make sure it matches your own and what you
think it should. So dna test for kids are actually a raid data check for your genes. If
you want to know if your photos aren't corrupted, you verify them, if you want to
make sure your genes will go on into the future, you have to check your kid.

Being nice

It is a random function with lots of noise as to whether being nice works out better than
being not nice. The Neanderthals and dodo birds didn't seem to fare well. Hell, there's all
kinds of things which aren't around anymore. Sometimes there can be only one survivor,
and sometimes you can have lots, and because chance exists, you can't really know which
path is right with absolute certainty.

Being attractive
Dancing

If you have a great body, dancing makes you hotter, if you wear different or crazy
clothes, it makes you cooler. If you are captain of the football team and great looking,
and you stalk a girl with binoculars through her window, you're cute. If you're fat or
ugly or both though, any of these odd behaviors will amplify the degree that people
dislike you. Imagine what a fat person looks like walking down the catwalk at a
fashion show, now imagine what the models looks like. How often do you see fat
people on the cover of magazines not called, "fat persons weekly" ?



Great fashion on bad bodies if prevalent enough will cease to be fashionable. That's
why you hear things like clothing brands paying certain people to stop wearing their
clothes.

Categorizing conversations by motive and type

In order to do better marketing, or better understand the world, analyze each comment in a
forum thread, or Reddit thread, and write the essence, the motive, of each comment down
next to the post. Then you will have a rough idea or menu of the bullshit you will see and
need to deal with anytime a similar or the same topic shows up again. I'm going to give that
a try with this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12271109 I know off the top of my
head, you usually get some Tithonous errors, and aesthetic keep the world what they
considered pretty comments, this one had an unusually amount of life sucks I want to die
comments. It's funny how obvious everything becomes when you give things a name. This
is like all the bullshit that people talk when you come up with a good idea and they just tell
you how hard it is, and why it won't work, etc. Yeah, I know its hard, you don't' have to
explain it to me, oddly all the things that I tell people to do that are hard, when they're
done, and they often are, turned out to not be that hard at all after all.

Good saying

Do you want to be happy or right? I say, why not both :)

Personality

Don't chase, replace (xx fill out)

There's power in admitting you're wrong, it's so rare these days that its very notable.
Displaying weakness, rare, unless you're baiting

Beating the bastard liars

Replace trust with verification

Since verification is cheap make people prove shit. You want to take significance with
stories, and I'll verify the significance check you've written with evidence, randomly
requested and generated. This is why timestamps work. Because editing video and
graphics takes too long to do well, to make it happen in short time frame. Must avoid
pre-playing attack. If they guess what you want, then your request isn't actually
urgent at all. It can be rainbow tabled, precomputed
Quality of life over time

Is it better to trick myself that I'm doing great things, when really I'm sitting uselessly
on my ass leeching the resources and productivity out of the other people in the world
that actually keep me safe, and develop the music and literature I might enjoy? And
fix my teeth when they're rotting out of my head, only to give little to nothing back in
return? Perhaps except for the warning I leave that live truly can be wasted. And this
is one way to do it, enhance the likelihood that you do it until the day you die.

Because you've found a way to like sucking.

Replace magnetism with gravity if you don't want to lose parts inside what you're
working on

IF you're building a computer case and you don't want to lose your screws into it, use
magnetic tools and ferrous screws, or turn it all upside down.. Then when something
falls off, it falls out instead of in. Just watch your eyes and don't get crushed

Scammers

When you get scammed, you harm more than yourself.

When you get fucked over, you do more harm to the world than you know. You're are
not the only person that gets fucked over. When you provide profit to cunning,
effective people, you rob the world of the great things they could have done had they
found no profit in scamming, and fell into honest work.

When you....

Game theory

Counting the counters.

Is it a trap? Has your enemy predicted your response? I suggest that the
likelihood that a person is using advanced tactics against you gets exponentially
less with every iteration. Some made up numbers to explore the idea: 50%
chance they're tricking you. 12.5% chance they're guessing you've detected the
trick, and will fuck you on your response. 6.25% chance they're guessing you'll
know they're fucking you on response, and are going to counter your counter to
their counter to the original fucking. So basically you just run a counter. Every
time you run a he knows I know loop, the counter goes one higher, and the
likelihood that it's actually occurring is less and less.

Look at the whole picture

Look at it like this, in the universe of all things happening, what portion of
that set is people just trying to fuck people over, let's call it 10 percent for
fun. Now of that 10 percent what portion are actually relying on a
successful anti-fucking over program to be executed for them to win, like
blowing up the paramedics and firemen that show up after a bombing.
Well, quite few, because most fools fall for the original scam just fine.
Thus, maybe 10 percent of the 10 percent of the world doing scams is
waiting for your response. Thus only 1 percent of scammers are relying
on your successful counter to their trap, to counter your counter.

Lawyers are people whom you give your fortune in order to prevent
someone else from getting it. You could say that their business is based on
people trying to counter fuckery.

Reloading

Scammers have a thing they call reloading, where you call everyone that
has been fucked over by a scam, and tell them you're going to help them
get their money back, but in reality, you're just going to scrape the
whatever morsels of meat might be left on their bones, and you know
you're likely to get them, because they've already proven themselves
fools for falling for the first scam.


Introduction





Influence, rhetoric, relationships, interacting with others, giving and taking direction, getting

compliance, being a leader, finding and being worth of passionate love

Introduction

This chapter is better called respect if you're used to be subordinate, and better called
influence if you're in a position of having more power than those around you. Basically the
chapter is better or worse named based on the situation you find yourself in. In order to be
respected, other conscious actors need to be aware of you. However, you can be influential
and anonymous, or even influential and hated and disdained. It's a rather hard chapter to
name.

Your responsibilities

Failing your family

(could be health or risk management, probably health instead of relationships, but your
friends and family could have problems other than health, so open issue)

I watched my father stop breathing over and over again while snoring for years. I didn't
know it was hurting his health. My ignorance cost him years of his life. How many health
problems do you or your loved ones have that just no one has ever noticed? Had a girlfriend
that had interstitial cystitis, and every doctor had her taking cranberry juice and making it
worse. Doctors are human, you are human, if you've got anything other than totally perfect
health, google it. Just don't be a hypochondriac.

Be a great follower

The best leaders are great followers, you just rarely get to see it
Who you should respect

Taking advice from a risky person is like taking risky advice from a knife juggler. Yeah, they
might be able to give you good advice or maybe they're already doing some bad decisions
with their knife juggling in the first place.

Your image

Don't make jokes too good at your expense

If you're funny and creative and you make too much fun of yourself, the dumb dumbs
around you will just chant you once original joke over and over till you wish you didn't make
it

Protector of family

Story about my first gf in bowling alley, and other high value awesomeness. What more
should they care about than protector of family
Failing your loved ones (family risk management)

Letting them die too easily

Collision avoiding blinking yellow vehicles, or are you ok with them dying?

Media Bias

Media bias, what kind of photo did they include of the person they're speaking about? If
they chose a terrible, or angry photo, when more neutral photos were available, you will
know ton of the article before you even read it. The images used to show a person can be
more influencing than the words.

Shit talk is unavoidable

You know that person that can put out a video or be on television and doesn't get shit talked
and insulted in comments? No? Correct. Everyone gets shit talked and insulted, and I do
mean everyone, even mister fucking Rogers. Therefore, don't worry so much about being
shit talked, it's unavoidable.

Communication

Speak at scale



No more one-to-one conversations, speak at scale, pay for the scale, whatever it takes.


Big words are signaling mechanism, to indicate that you might be smart or you might like big
words too much. I don't know, if it's so important to you to use twenty dollar words.

Effective communication: Over-complexifying things to look smart is the opposite of smart.
Use the cheaper word. It's hard enough to get people do anything in this world, especially if
you have to Google what you have said.

Saying "thank you" and not saying please is a better, more effective, more efficient way to
interact with people. If your friends and people you interact with and people that you might
be asking to, or telling to, do things are so concerned that they might get fucked out of
gratitude upon completing their task they need to preemptively, contractually look at you
funny and make sure that you say "please" beforehand - they're petty and you don't have
real trust and you don't care about timing or effectiveness.


The artful implementation of vulnerability where you're not going to get the shit cock block
out of you, probably generates some power that can't be had any other way.


Basically, all of the words with like conscious agent and if you don't speak the language that


you must speak in order to understand a text; if they're using words that you can't define
and don't know what they specifically mean in this esoteric branch of understanding a
science, you're totally fucked. You have to stop at every sentence and go look up the
meaning of the word and hope to memorize it before you even go on. You don't get two
more words until you're hit with another word that you have no idea what the fuck it
means. The very specific meaning is the difference between understanding it or having a
chance to and completely getting wrong and keeping it wrong because you don't have
someone else there to show you how you got it wrong.


My point is, the same things that makes a movie interesting, the same that make a story
interesting, the same things that make you click a link, the same things that make a picture
that you have the picture that you saved instead of all the other pictures that you've seen, if
you're not speaking in those terms, if you're not speaking in those terms which human
beings are interested by, then nearly tautologically whatever you're doing is uninteresting.
Unless you got lucky to have become interesting by accident through achieving a result you
didn't set out to achieve, you really should be speaking the language, the emotional,
motivational, moving, addictive, worthy of telling your friends about language that human
beings care about. Not that they should, not that they will, but that they do give a fuck
about. Whenever you read, touch or interact with something that I create, please make sure
that we're speaking the language that people care to notice, care to spread and care to
speak and are moved by and feel. Not the clinical, logical, cerebral, alien textbook style shit
that people have selected against every single time they've had the ability to.

Speak well

Great listening makes for great speaking

If you want to say great things, you need to read and hear great things

If you want to transmit wonderfully, you must absorb wonderfully. The
language and literature, even the music you absorb will color and literally be the
content you process and retransmit into the world. If you happiness, observe




joyous things. If you want powerful communication, absorb powerful
communication.

Downward intonation.

Powerful and effective speakers rarely end their sentences with upward intonation.
Why would they? Hehe. See what I did there? I used a couple questions and
upwards intonation to make a nice refrain, from the chorus of commands.

Downwards intonation is how people know you mean business. How you say things is
more important than what you say. Say it like you mean it. Your subconscious is
listening to you when you speak as well, and if it hears you speak something forcefully
enough, often enough, your very identity itself will tend to merge with the speech.
Empowering language

Positive and results oriented language

Work should be retitled to production, or another results work instead of work word.
Effort isn't what you should be focused on, this isn't the gym,
we're not trying to stress our system, we're trying to effect the world, and if
effortless, then lOx better.

Virality

An analysis of images and videos that have spread virality shows they have these xx in
common.

Meme magic

Memes, as you know them on the internet at least, are funny, interesting,
addctive ways to see the world. Memepower is a thing, and certain groups of
people try to make good memes to spread ideas that aren't so popular. For
instance primarily racist, biggoted, misogynistic, etc 4chan/pol uses
"mememagic" to try and get their ultraconservative ideas more traction, and it
works. The memes can be hillarious, and thus viral
http://knowvourmeme.com/photos/1077489-donald-trump
Anthropomorphize

We're built to deal with other thinking creatures, thus we're likely to see thinking
actors in all things. Why not harness that common mental mis-programming for
something good.

Mix up your tactics

Don't use the same word twice in the same sentence, or in near proximity unless
there's a really compelling reason to do so.

Alliteration

We like when 2 words right after each other have the same sound. Some people get
mislead when they're creating these, because
How you describe something is usually more important than what it is.

Many the great idea has been lost, because it was never described properly. What
seems like falling on deaf ears is often just a poorly delivered story.

If you already have a wonderful idea, and you can state it in a way that people
understand it, then really the only things you can do to improve that idea are the
artistry and feeling of the idea. If the facts are all wonderful, then you should find the
right words, packaging, analogies, similes, to make it compelling. Which of these two
true statements do you like more?

A. Eating fruit is better for dental health than eating candy.

B. An apple a day keeps the dentist away



One of these is a famous and memorable saying. The other...not so much.

Write well

Great reading makes for great writing

Read the greats to write like the greats
Don't use complicated language
Large numbers

I think people understand what a million is, it's a lot. I don’t think they feel
properly what a billion is. I don’t think they really get that it’s 1000 million. So
I’m literally going to use the term 1,000 million instead of billion because it has
superior emotional effect.

you probably need to move much of the intro to this location. Also a fair amnt of that

Turn everything you generate that's a graph or text into an infographic. They should

free way to do it as well, but for 5 bucks, why would you bother looking for it?

All conversations usually have the same form

The sooner you can identify which arguments are which, you can throw the useless
ones away, or educate the proponents that they spent time supporting X, and would
serve themselves and the world better supporting Y instead. Not all of the
conversational vectors have the same benefits or payoffs. Changing how people feel
about a thing doesn't help them address the underlying cause. Someone stole my
wallet. You should've had a chain on it, you shouldn't have carried it, you should have
known about that neighborhood, shit happens, and then one actually fucking useful
person says, oh yeah I saw that happen, I know that guy, he got arrested right after
that, you should go check at the police station they probably have it. All the other
commenters were pretty much useless dickheads compared to that last guy.

Agreeable speech

Saving face

Say "and" instead of "but", even if it feels weird. It will feel better to them, and they'll
understand what your meaning without the distrust of all words following "but". Feel how
these sound. [Breakfast was great "but"....the toast was burnt.] or [Breakfast was great
"and" the toast was burnt.] Most people get upset a bit the moment they hear the word
"but" because over a lifetime of conversations, we've been trained that everything after the
but is no fun to hear.



You could play with the converse and ruin good compliments by inserting "but" in them
instead of "and." Just to see how powerful the words are. [You looked great tonight "and" I
liked your perfume.] or [You looked great tonight "but" I liked your perfume.]

Do: Remove personality: Replace "why" with "for what reasons" and don't use the
word "I"


No one wants to be thought a fool, thus people are often slow to admit wrong doing
or thought. The less social cost and more social profit you can attach to what you're
trying to sell, the easier a pill it will be for people to swallow. This is why it's great to
remove identity from the issue, because when people don't have to save face.

If you give someone the option to hide their true belief and appear smart, or be
truthful and appear stupid, it's often more profitable for them to appear smart. Many
the job and lover has been lost over speaking the truth. Thus the truth is often less
profitable than the lie, and this is the profit you are working against, or to replace, as a
truth spreader.

Arguing

Idiot's immunity (Ignorance/Logic immunity amplitude coupling.)

The more the person needs an intervention, the less likely the intervention is to work.
It's hard to reason people out of ideas they didn't reason themselves into. The
more logical your idea, the easier it is for logic to sway you back to straight. It's
like triage on the battlefield, it's much easier to repair people that are less
damaged. The exceptions are beliefs that people have, that they never really
thought much about.

Rhetorical tactics

Heads I win, tails you lose.

Truth finding

Beat the truth out of people, tactically speaking

If you want people to actually tell you the bad news, you need to
presuppose there is some, or they’ll just avoid it. e.g. So what is wrong
with the plane today captain? Or more specifically, name three things
wrong with the plane today. This is like asking for the first four digits a of a
credit card number, instead of the entire thing at once. Small hoop. Small
hoop, big hoop.

Going out to eat, The 5-2-1 restaurant game










You name 5 restaurants, they pick two, you choose between them. (5-2-1 game) You can
move the numbers around a bit, the key idea is that you trade choosing back and forth from
a set.

One cuts, one chooses

Divide a cake, one person cuts, one person chooses. Two partners write down in secret
what they would pay to buy the other one out. Whichever one picks the higher number
gets to keep the business.

Feedback

Punishment and reward

Intermittent reward (xx lose the dolphin reference)

Learned from dolphin trainers, you can't always punish bad behavior, you have to randomly
make things good. Intermittent reward is more addictive and interesting than being
steadfast in your ways. You have to prime the pump of good behavior.

Attempted fuckery

Any time someone attempts to fuck you, or anytime a company uses advanced sales
tactics, it means they're more likely to fuck you somewhere else. If they don't care
about you in the small things, it’s unlikely they will care about you in the big things.
Just like attempted murder, you must punish or penalize people for attempted
fuckery.

Stress testing

You can actually test to what degree people are terrible by offering them the chance
to abuse you, and seeing if they take it. At some point it is entrapment, but at another
point, it's like checking for cavities with a metal implement. Yeah, you don't strap your
teeth with stainless steel all the time, they probably wouldn't like, it, but it is a great
way to discover a problem before it is too late.

Don't fix. Fire.

For the same reason that we get frustrated so easily, because the solution is much more
likely to be just trying something else instead of doing the same thing for harder and longer,
the environment that we live in has never been more suited by replacing instead of fixing
people. When you have a problem or a bunch of problems with someone, you can try and
fix them, and what you will discover is that people rarely, if ever, change for the better, yet
quite commonly change for the worse. Now this might just be because you don't care to
value all of the things that they have change for the better, and it's a form of confirmation
bias, however in this case, that bias would be considered having high standards for what you
should give a shit about in another person's behavior. I don't care if you stopped killing
innocent animals in a video game to be a nicer guy, while you are double clocking out for
lunch and double clocking back in, so that you are actually getting paid to eat lunch while
everyone else you work with is not. That's why there is a clock on the wall there, so you only
get paid for the hours you actually work.

Thus, because of social media, the Internet, job sites, etc., it's never been easier to find
someone so good and amazing to work with, that you had no idea such a person even
existed. Just like relationships. Back in the old days, everyone would get married to
someone that grew less than 15 minutes from where they grew up, because the world was



literally a quite smaller place back then. Nowadays, we have so much exposure to the entire
rest of the planet, that you would think everyone in the world had 6-pack abs, because
that's all you see on magazines and Instagram. At least on my account, lol. (*xx joke)

The key to firing instead of fixing working is that you must have a constant lead flow, or
ability to replace in a timely manner. The less options you have, the shittier your life will be,
because when people know you have no or few options, they treat you worse.

When you fire over fix as policy, the people you interact with will treat you better than they
would if you didn't. It gives them a real tangible profit to treating you well that
unconditional lovers can't offer. Unconditional love makes people feel like they're not
getting paid for their work. People hate not getting paid for their work.

Enemies

Internet trolls(Thought vandals). Verbal bullies.

Significance driven people who are happy to create pain. Usually those who wish to harm
others are executing a strategy with the subconscious motive that they wish to be treated
better, whether they deserve it or not. It's like mental extortion. If you they don't get
treated the way they want, they'll hurt you. "That's a real nice mood you have there, it
would be a shame if something were to... happen to it.... Right?"

Mods

AMOG's

Getting to the truth

[XYZ country you're in] girls know how to treat their boyfriends right, they never break up, "How
long have you been with your boyfriend?" This gives them a compliment if they admit they have a
boyfriend. You want to presuppose the worst case and give them a benefit for admitting it.
They're smart. They know that the second someone detects that they're not in the market for
some afterhours loving, the conversation is over. When the only thing you have to offer is your
body, and it's not on offer, people get out of there real quick. So they avoid letting you know that
your only use to them is to entertain them while they burn some time before they go home to
fuck their boyfriend. Get your tap dance shoes on!

Romance

Sort

Unless you're really in a lead-starved environment, leave the tall girls for the taller guys.

Intro

Are you looking for?

a. New relationships

b. Better sex

c. Lots and lots of sex

Lonely? Be amazing and see how long you can stay lonely

On a long enough time scale, nothing escapes the odds. If you're a giant loser make it
a mission to see how worthy you can become, without still getting a woman, and
you'll find the world isn't stupid, and if you're attractive, you people will be attracted
to you, goes almost without saying, but some people are so far demoralized that they
can't see the obvious truth of it.

Choose your life

Pickup artists aren't fulfilled, they're empty

If you analyze the lives of successful pickup artists, you won't find a whole lot of
happiness. The problem with getting addicted to a time consuming game, where 90



percent of the time you're not having fun, or at least complaining quite a bit, is that
you create a hole in your life, where no matter how much pussy you get, it's never
enough.

In the hunt to be with others, you may never feel more alone. When you put yourself
out there, and expose yourself to the world, you're going to suffer many insults. That
is the barrier to entry that will allow you to do what others only dream of. If everyone
else had the balls that you will, to say hello to people you find interesting, and
improve yourself relentlessly, then there would be little profit in it, for everyone was
doing it. You would need to do all those things just to break even. Lucky for you, you
live in a world full of people living below their potential. Lucky for this book too, for if
everyone was already perfect, there would be little need for a book of excellence.
Talk of the trade

101: Indicators of interest

EC: Eye contact

BFF: Big fat friend

Set: Group of people

In set: gaming in a group of people

Bounce: go to next club

Eject: leave the set

Neg: calibrated indicator of non-interest
Alpha: Leader of the pack

Spin Plates: Have a few girls you are romantically involved with at once.=

Cougar: 30+ year old woman who is down to fuck / predatory
Mixed set: group with guys and girls in it
Calling out locations

If you are out with a wing, you're going to be calling out positions quite a
bit, so you should xx reference the section on calling out locations, like
"Check your 6"="Look behind you"

AMOG: Alpha male other guy
Bitch shield: Acting unsocial by default

Oneitis: Being overly concerned with a single romantic interest
3 second rule: If you see something you want to open, go NOW and do it.

Hired guns: waitresses, promoters, strippers, models

LMR: Last minute resistance, you're in bed naked, but she doesn't want to play, hide
the salami

AA: approach anxiety

Blow out: fail out of set with low value

Stall out: run out of material

Genpop: general population, not the VIP area

Humble brag: Displaying value without looking like that is your intent.

Look great

Stop eye fucking everyone

They can't look at you when you're staring at them. They can't absorb your style and
become attracted, when they're too scared to look, because if they even come close
to looking your direction, you'll lock eyes with them and make them feel weird.

Fakeness is friend

STFU about your problems



You're supposed to be the path to value, not the path to the suck. No health
problems, no weird issues, no problems of any kind unless you're humble
bragging.

Privacy is profit

We've evolved to be private, so that people see the best sides of us. No one
posts their worse selfies, for everyone's idea of who you are, is actually only
what they've seen of you. Thus, control their image of you, and you change
who you are to them in their reality. Their reality is the most important thing
they know.

Fakeness and privacy don't seem that important to anyone until they are
stripped of them. Imagine a world where hiding your body is illegal. Imagine a
world where there can be no private conversations. No more makeup, no more
clothing, and all phone logs, emails, and mail are to be made public and tied to
your identity.

Ok, so now what does the world look like?

Girls all of the sudden look quite odd. Less red in the cheeks, more little red
dots. Makeup, fashion and social media are like professional wrestling on
television, they're fun to watch, and not real.

Finding great people

Meeting people you don't know

Some of the principles here aren't applicable outside cold approach. If you're in a big
group that went to the VIP together and you're already interested in one of the girls
with you there, then you are already warm, you're not doing cold approach. Only
some of these

o What does great look like?

• People to beware of
Drama queens

They might not be able to find significance by being prettier or smarter,
but they can hurt your feelings, and through being able to cause you that
pain, become quite important to you, and themselves. For only they
could be begged to stop hurting you right?

Outliers gonna lie.

The crazier the hair and face piercings, the crazier drama you're
likely to get. If you're willing to do more adventurous things to your
body, you're probably more likely to do more adventurous things
with your behavior. What could be more adventurous than taking a
bunch of dangerous pills and calling your boyfriend to tell them
about it, or hurt themselves and tell people their boyfriend did it, or
poison you.

Can you still find your fair share of drama from normal looking
people? Yep, you're just playing the odds. If you like kinky sex,
Weirder piercings tattoos and hair also increase the chances they're
down for that too. Adventurous people rarely restrict the boundary
breaking to a single domain.



o If you go where you fit in, people will like you more.

If you're the only white guy at a black club, and you happen to meet a few of the only
white girls at the black club, you're likely to discover they're there because they prefer
dating black people, which is why they're at the black club. The same goes for most
other heavily minority clubs. People go where the music and crowd is what they like,
and if you're not similar to the people in that crowd, you're likely to be shunned. If
you're the guy wearing a 3 piece suit at the beach at the nude beach, its likely to be
frowned upon. Respect peoples preferences and put the odds in your favor.

Walk faster in between clubs

Reduce your transition time, moving sets suck and if you're in the streets moving sets
are all that's there.

Attracting great people

When you are attractive, people want to say yes to you before they even know what the
question is.

Opening

If you look at what you're talking about, instead of their face, it lends authenticity to
your comment being genuine, and not just an excuse to talk to her. If you don't face
her like your dinner, then she might think you're making a funny passing comment,
and not trying to hook up with her. Guys that try to hook up with her are lower value
than the guys that she can only admire from a distance, because they don't care about
her.

When you give away your liking of someone for free, you rob them the opportunity of
earning it and being proud of the achievement.

Fucking time wasters

If you're interesting and fun, who wouldn't want to talk with you? Thus, once your
game is on point, you need to make sure that the people who you are gracing with
your presence are worthy. Worthy could be defined as Brain, Money, Pussy, Giggles.
What else matters? The brain and pussy is only as useful as it leads to the Pussy and
Giggles. You could even call the pussy a subset of giggles. Here's how you separate
the worthwhile from the time wasters.

Bad sets

I've never found a way to unburn toast. I've also never reliably defeated the big fat
friend
Compliance

Hoop theory

One hard thing, two easy things. This is similar to 2 steps forward, one step
back. It's why prices end in 9's. They're harder to add up and see how far
you've come.

Don't ask for compliance you're not going to get, or you'll get a "State break."

If you get a compliance failure, its bad, really bad. Once people are used
to saying no, you're screwed. Yes momentum relies on getting no no's.

Teasing

2 steps forward, 1 back

Positional game

Avoid the VIP

In case the VIP area is actually strict about entry. Girls don't buy bottles nor
have tables at the VIP, it's only bros. Since the only girls in the VIP were invited



there by guys, you're much better off working in general population, because
you're more likely to find a girl or two that isn't already locked into set with an
army of bros willing to waste money and attention on them.

Posture
In the club

Girls in the loudest area in the middle of the dance floor don't want to chat.

Girls at the end of the bar looking down it long ways are usually interested in
the staff, and won't burn that dream to hook up with anyone that's not staff
there.

Dancing amplifies your body

If your body sucks, now you look worse. If your body is good, and you dance
well, now you look better. Most people that have problems with girls don't have
good bodies. Off the dance floor game is a safer bet than on the dance floor, as
far as opening goes.

Enjoy your new lovers

Now you've found a great person you're taking home with you!

After parties

You're going to have things stolen. Sometimes on accident, sometimes on
purpose. Glasses are going to break, people are going to bleed on your walls,
random underwear will appear in places they obviously don't belong.

Depending on how much you drank, the person you're with might look quite
different from what you remember. The light of morning can make

End game

If you like saving money on your taxes, maybe getting married is an option for you. Get a
prenuptial agreement. Good paper makes good friends. If someone has a million dollar
reason to not think you're funny anymore, you'll discover your get a lot less laughs. Aligning
incentives works great. If you want to blow your marriage up, just keep stacking rewards for
it to end. If you want your marriage to last, then stack rewards that make lasting profitable.
Sort in Romance

Phone numbers

Do you like wasting your time? Then definitely think phone numbers are useful. The
only thing that is useful is attraction and thus compliance. If you don't have
compliance, your phone call will be answered. If she's not attracted, and answers
anyway, you're just going to be wasting your time

The good sets are good fast

Fighting for every inch sucks hard. If it's the end of the night though, it's the best you
got.

Hollering at women in the street

Stop. It does not work. It has never worked. You are raising the bitch shields and
ruining the peacefulness of public places everywhere. When the inevitable happens,
and whatever you hollered doesn't have any positive effect, do you yell out something
like BIIIIITCH or LESBIANS etc.? Go home, beat yourself with a stick for a while, and
never do that again. What if every store you visited yelled "Fuck you!" at you when
you left without buying something?

Calibrated negs

If you neg too hard, they don't care to buy value back from you with good behavior.
Negs are only as useful as they change your targets behavior. The neg strength needs
to match the target.



Girls go on vacation where the guys they want to have sex with live

If you know a girl that is learning Spanish, and likes to vacation in Spain, she probably
loves Spanish cock. If you know a Dutch girl, and she loves vacationing in Curacao, she
probably loves black cock. Girls aren't stupid, they like boys and prefer to be around
the ones they find more attractive rather than less.

Girls also go to clubs where the color/style of the people they want to fuck also go

If you're into white chicks and you go to reggae night at the local club, and you find a
couple white girls there, you're not so likely to do well with them, because they are
likely into the dark meat, and in this example you're not the dark meat. You're going
to do better in clubs where you fit the style, because the people that attend the club
are rather preselected to enjoy that style, that's why they are there.

Terrain awareness. It takes tons dirt to find a bit of gold.

If you froze time, took all the girls in the club and lined them up in a row in front of
you, then started separating them out by their objectives with sex as your filter, here's
what you might see:

Out of 100 girls, let's just take all the ugly ones, make giant clothed human
centipede with them for giggles for when they wake. Now you've got 10 girls
left. Let's look at their motives first. Let's remove the ones that have boyfriends.
Ok, now you've got 4 left. Now let's remove the ones on their period, girls spend
about 25 percent of their life on their periods, so now you've got 3 girls left.

Now with the 3 girls that are left, you get to see which one isn't locked into set
with 7 friends that are like crabs and grab her arm as soon as you try to take her
to the bar.

Then you've got the other dudes that have solid game already working to do the
same thing you are, assuming she didn't already get to the club with them. Then
there's the ones locked into the middle of the dance floor, all facing each other,
what fun, I can't wait to go try and dance in the middle of the 7 strangers, for an
unknown amount of time, before being told to fuck off non verbally.

Or you could wait by the ladies room, or at the bar, etc., basically the game is
hard as fuck, and out of 100 girls, you might not get a single actually down to
fuck, logistically ok one.

We didn't even actually filter out all the other bullshit, like, doesn't like
whatever color you are, has too many face tattoos and piercings, or actually
wants to spend time with a friend from out of town, etc. Now you begin to see
how hard the numbers game is, so if 100 girls won't do the trick, and the bar
only seats 50. I guess you're going to have to go to lots and lots of clubs.

You ever notice no pretty girl goes to a bar or club alone? If by chance you do
run into it, YOU ARE SO LUCKY HAVE FUN! Easiest fun you will ever have!

They're less than 1 out of 20 of the girls you'll hook up with in my experience. If
you prefer cougars, you might have a higher ratio.

Know your enemy, most people are wastes of time, literally

The big fat friend, unless turned, is definitely your enemy. The arm yanking piece of
shit whose only mission is to make sure your conversation ends, is your enemy. The
dumb guys yelling dumb shit at girls, raising their bitchshields are usually the enemy,



there's really only a couple useful people in the club. Your wingmen, the staff that
likes you, your target, and girls that find you interesting, and are down to do more
than waste your time. You only have a few hours to get the job done. You don't have
time to fuck about.

Drinking

Many of the good sets have been lost to over drinking, if you've got it in the bag, slow
the fuck down with the drinks. Just like getting a yes to a sale, shut the fuck up. No
more talking. You can't get any more sold, but you can fuck it up. You lost way more
points with a single fuck up than you gain with several good plays.

The clubs are there to make money, so spend money, unless you like being barred
entry.

Queueing

Unless you happen to be queueing directly next to a hot fun girl, it's a giant waste of
time. If you don't need to queue for drinks, don't. If you don't need to queue for
entry, don't. Waiting in queue next to non-targets is a giant waste of time you could
be spending opening, or getting on the next club.

New club always beats waiting

If you're going out early, go to the shittier clubs first, it's better to save your best
hunting ground for when it's the busiest, than go too early, and then have to move on
to crappier clubs, because if you're not in set, you keep fucking moving! You don't
gain any value staring and scanning the club like a predator, you lose it. So get the fuck
in, open, it works well or it don't, usually it don't, keep moving! When it works, stay!
You can be working on your body when going out isn't a good option

There are more hours in the day where you can be improving yourself than there are
good opportunities to run game
The imaginary land where naturals don't game.

This is similar to the world where girls don't care what they look like. Girls that you
think don't care, do care, and guys that you think don't game, game. They may not
know what the fuck they're doing, but upon closer analysis you'll see they're doing
lots of things right they might not notice, but you do.

Non-verbal signaling

Don't lean in, don't turn towards the set, be body rocking out. If it seems sensible, you
might have some place to go.

Death words

In sales, "You are a really good salesman". In game "weird," "gay" I eject on either of
these pretty much. I do a hard Kino test on the gay one, just to make sure
Cold approach pickup sucks hard 90 percent of the time

Depending on how you define suck. If you go out 10 times and get laid 1 time, and
getting laid is pretty much all you care about, then it could be said that 90 percent of
the time is you saying the same things over and over again to people you wouldn't call
friends, or associate with, except for the fact that having sex with them might be fun.

Game

Certain last names might have sex more often

The most popular last name in your country, if only given by true parents,
means that family tree has the high score for having sex and surviving. To some
degree you could say you're more likely to have kids with someone with that
last name, than others because they have proven to have more than most. In



some countries like Vietnam everyone just changed their name, which is why
there are so many Nguyen's. But in many other countries, it's more accurate.

Finding love
Intro

XX.

This may be too sciency, people want laid, not to reshape the universe.
This is also way male focused, need to go back over and make sure the
female perspective is handled. Might be fun to just go hard man and hard
woman instead of weak middle ground through most of it.

We care about love, or at least lust, A LOT

You ever notice how many movies have a love interest in them? How
about in songs? Why is it, that even war movies shove some romance
into their plots? It may come as no surprise to you, we really care about
love. A lot. You see, without love, your parents wouldn't exist. You
wouldn't exist. Your kids wouldn't exist either. If we didn't take this stuff
really seriously, we'd be out of the game for good, replaced by those that
did. We come into this world weak and weary, without a tit to suck on and
someone to protect us for years, we wouldn't survive. Few animals stay
so weak for so long as we humans. Everyone is really sensitive regarding
matters of the heart.

Only life and ideas stand the test of time

Life and ideas have been fighting back disorder forever. Their order is
how you can tell them from the background noise of their surroundings.
Their order is their identity. Think about it.

In a thousand years, what could you build that would still be here? Two
things. An idea, or life itself. Only life has the power to maintain order and
fight off the decay that is the normal order of the world we live in. If you
throw a banana in your yard, and watch it over time, you'll see that one
day it's not there anymore. The process of dissolving and ceasing to be is
what only life can prevent. Ideas themselves are but the inhabitants of
life. For if now living thing carries the idea, does it truly exist?

Life is an idea that carries ideas

Life is a funny thing, for not only is it the only good place for ideas to live,
but it is an idea itself. Life is data. From when you were a cell in your
mother and a cell in your father, to a single cell, and now billions of cells.
Those cells did only what they were programmed to do, by the very long
and magical strings of data inside them. You are the physical execution of
the good programming in your DNA. Ideas are carried by life, and life
itself is an executed idea.

If you want to live forever, you have to create ideas or life that are strong
enough to make it. On the ideas, you can do it solo, if you must. For the having
kids though, that's much more fun with a partner or two. Maybe you don't care
so much about kids as a creation, but love for its own sake. That's great too.
Let's find you some fun partners to roll around with!



The game

The 10's get the 10's (play in the league you qualify for)

The 9's get the 9's. On it goes. You get the idea. Are you a 10? Nope. A
9? Nope. Ok, so what are you? Well that depends on who's looking.
Everyone likes different things at different times. Girls when they're
growing up might love six packs and pretty faces. Then when they're in
their late 20's, they might like guys with more money and class. Then
when they're in their 30's, they may go cougar mode and prefer the young
meat again. You can't be all things to all people, and you shouldn't want
to be. You should want to be the best you that gets what you want while
still enjoying the process. You should choose your identity, not the sea of
random women you're interested in.

Would you like to make love to 10's? Yeah, me too. Matter of fact, who
wouldn't? Ok, so how many 10's have you seen in person? Now you
know why barely anyone gets to be with 10's. They're hard enough to
even find in the real world, let alone outcompete the thousands of men
waiting in line, or wishing to.

Like all things we understand well, we can put some numbers on it. This is the
Scivivor's Love Interest Theorum "SLIT"

How hot you are, times how many people can see and respond to it, divided by
your standards. That's it.

SLIT

(Hotness x tactics) / standards = relationships

So if you increase your hotness, and you do better tactics, does that mean you
will have good relationships? Nope. Lasting relationships? Nope. Quality and
durability are some of the standards that fight against the work you did in
hotness and tactics.

Thus, you can only do three things. Become hotter, make the hotness you have
do better work, or lower your standards. And one of those things sucks.

Being the best you

Just like discipline shits on motivation, so too does personal development shit
on tactics. When you are waking up next to the person you made love to the
night before, the hype has faded away, all the cards have been laid bare on the
table. What is left? What's left is everything that wasn't the hype. The real you.
Is this real you something you took years to refine and be proud of? Is this real
you someone others are envious of? Or is this real you a normal joe that used
advanced tactics and effort to achieve what prettier men achieve by accident?

They both work, but one stops working when you go to sleep. The other keeps
radiating. If you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you are so at rest and in motion.

If your attractiveness needs you to be telling the next cool story, or showing off
what you have, what happens when they've heard all you have to say? Where is
your cool stuff when you're at the beach? Being an attractive man, whether it's
through looks or personality, pays for a life time. It is your true identity. Spitting



game and manipulating circumstance wears off quite quickly. If you could trade
all the hours you've spent trying to find love, for hours spent making yourself
stronger, prettier, richer, which one would have higher and more lasting value?

When you're done hard selling, the work you did with that one person doesn't
carry over to the next person, you start from scratch. When you're done hard
working on yourself, that effort lasts forever, this person or the next.

You will bring you to your next relationship. Being the best you is the strategy
that makes all the tricks and tactics of conquest seem small. Now, what if you
are already deep into personal development? Well, checking SLIT since you've
already got a big "hotness", you'll get the most gains by increasing your tactics.
Or, lowering your standards, but seriously.. Low standards are the father of
regret.

Working the SLIT

You could lower your standards. If that sounds good to you, put this book down,
right now, and hand it to someone worthy. This book is about getting what you
want, not getting what you don't want.

What are these tactics of which you speak?

:) This is the fun stuff. As in sports, the tactical win may not last a lifetime,
but., damn it feels good to be a winner.

Fashion

At a distance, your face isn't visible, but your clothes are. The saying, the clothes
make the man, is pretty accurate at midrange. Posture and who you're with
matter as well.

Three guys is a crowd

PUAs are tigers, and tigers don't do well in packs. PUAs invite you to meet other
PUAs. Normal people invite you to meet women. Two can be ok, three is a
crowd.

Pickup

Go with the flow

When women approach you, after you've got significance and rapport, or if you
started off with it, try and move them away from the crowd they came from, instead
of back into it. Since they were already there, and they walked away from it, they
obviously prefer not to be there, and maybe there's a guy she likes, or girl she hates,
or too much smoke or the music is too loud, etc. You don't want to waste your
influence points pushing them back upstream, you've got better things to use those
precious points for:)

Optimal time to go out

It's a common mistake that people make that they want to go out and meet new
people on holidays, like St. Patrick's day. What they don't realize is that that's when
people are most likely to have set groups that they want to hang out with and they're
not most open to meeting new people. Therefore, the best time to meet new people
is when those people are down to meet new people. If you're trying to interject
yourself amongst tight-knit groups of people who pride themselves on excluding
others, you're going to get excluded.



Know your wing rules before you head out with your wing
A wing that cock blocks you is not a wing.

Introduce your wing last to the girl you want him to wing
Then his conversation with her will be uninterrupted.

Whoever opens chooses (they almost always choose the prettier one)

Be Fashionable

Give people power over you

What that really means is, give other people power over you, so that you can have
power over them. Their taste decides how you will dress and act, and once you meet
their subconscious desires, executing their subconscious will in the real world, you
then get to have power over them. There's an order of operations, you don't get to
lead until you can follow. The best leaders are great followers, you just rarely get to
see it.

Buy Boots

Well boys, if you've been paying attention to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and
all the very successful short dudes out there - if girls want height and you want more
height, well, you better put on them boots. Thank Nicolas Sarkozy as well.

Boots look cooler and they make you taller, how can you lose?

Wear colors

If you dress different, get your value spike in there, so they think that you're better
instead of worse. Unless they're fearful, and then they'll just not like anything
different at all. To mention that there's only texture, color, shape and pattern in
regards to what you can wear. If you don't like it, be covered in black, preferably a flat
black that's not shiny.

Color matching

Influence people by how you dress

It's easy to dismiss others problems when you haven't walked a mile in their shoes.
When you see the goth kids at school, and you see that one of them is sad because
they didn't get to attend this concert for a band they really like, a band you'd pay to
never hear, it's hard to relate. The same way it might be hard for that goth kid to
relate to a jocks problem of fumbling the balls, or handoff in a football play or striking
out in baseball. Each of these easily recognizable stereotypes appears to us as they do
because of how they look to us, and what they appear to do with their time. It is those
very differences that cause us to group them into different categories that are the
reasons that there will be differences in meaning and respect between them. Guess
what? When people look at you, they judge you and fit you into a stereotype as well.
The great news is that you can massively influence what other people think of you,
solely by how you dress. I've found that it truly doesn't cost much more to dress very,
very well as it does to dress very poorly. What great news! If you care what people




think *you should* then you have power over them you may never have realized,
solely by choosing the clothes that get the job done. Buy what's on the mannequin.


The best part of any outfit is the person wearing it.

Appear strong

You ever notice that animals never display weakness as a strategy. Like very, very rarely
does displaying weakness as a strategy ever happen. I can think of some prey animals that
have like a bait hook hanging from their head in the deep sea, like crazy Anglerfish and there
are probably a couple other examples of it, but this is nowhere near as common as faking
strength. R839 (Cuttlefish example - signals as female, sneaks past larger male -Human
example: Pretending to be gay to get past bitch shields and avoid competition)

Be mysterious

Mystery is power. Christ is such a powerful a figure because you don't know what music he
liked, or what his favorite food was, or how much he slept in a night, or if he woke up feeling


quite crappy before his morning coffee. D: (BATMAN - a symbol: "When you become more
than a man", something powerful in that. Problem with application?? Social media??) :D It


would be great to not dilute your social media image with mediocre content than to spam it
up and lose value. The best photographers don't show you their "ok" pictures, so you think
they're better than they are. If you saw all the bad photos all photographers take, you
wouldn't think as well of the. Let what people don't know about you speak on your behalf
through what they imagine of you based on your value spikes!


Value spikes

People go out to have a good time, and they like to meet interesting and fun people.
In our best moments we can all be interesting and fun. Let your best side show and
don't emphasize your worse sides. Let people figure out what and why you suck at
somethings on their own, no reason to shove it down their throat.


Get your value spikes in once you have presented your most attractive side, relax and let it
sink in. The more you speak to things that aren't your best stories or points, the more likely
you are to hit a trap. You only get one point for the great things you say that they love, and
you lose 5-10 points for everything you say that you don't like. Because it is easier to lose
points than to win them, it’s better for them to fill in their curiosity with their own
imagination based on the couple of value spikes you've gotten into the conversation than it
is for you to say the wrong thing and cancel out or more all the work you did to show your
best side.

Be attractive, don't be unattractive.

Attractive people get away with a lot

The amount of points that you lose for saying the wrong thing is tied to how much
the person already likes you. If they don't like you that much to being with, you will
lose a lot, if they are already like you a lot, you'll lose nothing and they'll make up a
rational reason to support you saying the thing that would have bothered a person
that liked you less. For instance if you love dogs, and the person you're talking to
hates dogs, if they're not so pretty, it's a deal breaker, but if they are quite pretty you
might say, I understand what you mean, yeah, dogs aren't for everyone. The take
away being, that mistakes don't have equal cost for prettier people. The uglier you
are, the more your mistakes cost you. Thus, if you're not so pretty, be aware that you









get 1 point for saying the right thing, and lose 10 points for saying the wrong thing, so
speak wisely.

Personality

Have more than one style of being

If you can act different ways, sing different songs, make funny faces and voices, then you
can act as you wish with whom you wish, because you've got so many outfits you can wear.

If however you've never imitated another person's voice or way of speaking, never made
cool facial expressions, never done anything exciting with your body, well then, you're not
really free, you have only one outfit to wear. If you're really smart, you can always pretend
you're stupider, and basically use your extra brain horsepower to properly emulate the
stupider existence. If however you are stupider, you won't have the option to passably act
as something greater, at least not with people that can detect how full of shit you are.
Silence speaks louder than yammer.

Trust

Never worth less, verification cheap, travel fast, no lag in verification

Others: Who is worthy of your time?

If you are meeting together solely based on your intellect, than you surely have found no greater
calling in life, for you should be meeting with people of like interest towards a greater goal, not
people of similar wasted potential.

You need to self-adjust your expectations for the impact that you're going to make in regards to
the people that you're speaking to. Not based on how smart and badass you are, because your
smartness and your badass of arguments and your correctness means nothing in the eyes of a
person that can't see that wavelength. How right and amazing you are, and all these great points
you have, literally just means the opposite to those people that look at you like an outsider, like an
alien, who are measuring who you are to them instead of what you're saying.

There are people in this world that will see you as a threat to their importance, to their
significance, that don't give a shit about the validity or accuracy of what you're saying, because
the entirety of your existence to them is as an outsider, as a competitor for resources. It's
someone that is trying to make them seem less important to their group by making them seem
wrong. Whatever they can say and whatever they can do to seem more important to their group,
they will do, regardless of whatever fanciful, advanced adhesion to logic that you have, because
you care about logic a lot, you've memorized all these fallacies and spent all these years learning,
city slicker. Whereas this guy, he cares that the people that he lives and works with like him, and
that's the end of his caring. He doesn't really care so much about epistemological truth, and the
hunting of it, and ultimate knowledge.

If you've been looking for a better peer group, and you should always be, I would suggest that you
do not try MENSA. What you will find in MENSA is people that are entirely wrong about things, but
wrong about them in a slightly more intelligent way. That is not that useful. It's better to find
people that are actually right. People that are actually right, particularly those that are right about
things most people are wrong about, are often powerful and often wealthy, because when
everyone else is wrong and you're right, you get exponentially rewarded. When everyone else is
right and you're right, there's no reward whatsoever. Value is in indirect proportion to availability.
When rightness is easily available from all kinds of places, no one will pay you for it, but when
you're the only one that knows a thing that everyone else has got wrong, they will pay you dearly,
and often times not even because they want to. They might have just bet against up. Oops! You



fucked up. Oh, and you even gave me odds, you gave me odds, it's not even one to one. So you
believe your shit because everyone else believes it. Wisdom of crowds, et cetera. I'm on the right
side, you're on the wrong side, you're going to pay me a multiple for the privilege of being right
when everyone else is wrong, that's great!

My belief in MENSA. I've only tried it a couple of times, I don't have a large enough sample set to
say it realistically, so I'll just reiterate what I've said previously; if you're so deprived of a social
group to cohere with, and be effective in the world through mission and shared desire and shared
interest, then you have defaulted to pretending that intellectual horsepower is somehow
magically an interest on its own. I assure you that it is not. Your ability to understand things speaks
nothing to the application of that ability. If you have the ability to learn a new language, and you
never learn it, then when some other guy joins MENSA and wants to speak to you in that
language, you aren't going to understand it. You're but in the club, you both passed the test. One
guy learned the other language, the other guy didn't.

Now they can't communicate with each other in that cool language. By the way, English is
awesome. Learn it. It's really cool. We got the most words! And the most papers, the best music,
and the best songs and I could go down the list. MENSA. I've never had good luck with it. I find
that you are able to remain stupider for longer by having a more advanced strategy and tactic to
avoiding compelling argument, which is weird, because you would think that only the acceptance
of compelling argument may cause someone to be smart in the first place. Take a guy like Ben
Stein. Ben Stein, really smart guy; really wrong about almost everything. God damn, how does that
happen?

Knowing the truth of those around you

Trust is weakness, verification is strength.

I think it would be great to do like real fact verification on people that are commonly
full of shit. In a world where it’s never been cheaper or easier to actually verify things,
when someone talks shit about what they've done, or who they know, or otherwise
attempt to steal significance for themselves from you with fancy statements, it's nice
to verify them on the spot, or let them know that without verification, you don't
believe a word people say.

Impact

Impactful professions

The professions you can create massive impact without the help of others are pretty limited
in quantity.

Writers, inventors, scientists, authors, artists, musicians, mathematicians, programmers,
biologists. Now of those professions, which are truly solitary in nature? Perhaps the most
solitary in order would be author, mathematician, artist, inventor. Musicians, scientists,
programmers, they often work in groups. Even in the case of the author, artist, musician,
what use is your work if it’s never seen or heard? Who will carry your work to the masses?
You see, to make an impact on this world, you're almost always going to need some other
people's help.

Thus, there is an optimal order of operations. The goal is to take advantage of the things
which can make massive and important impact in this world, which all involve people that
aren't you. The sooner you can enlist those people into your efforts, the sooner you can
start marking a difference.



Unsuccessful people telling you how to be successful

People that do this personal development will make you rich shit when the first money they
ever made in their entire life was the money they made telling you that they would make
you rich, and then you look in their history and they have no business experience
whatsoever and no success anywhere else. It would be interesting to see what percentage
of successful self-help authors were ever considered successful before their book on
success.

Thought leaders

Thought leaders are able to be thought leaders for the most part, because they failed so
hard, so long and were OK having no standards, and making no money to stay in the game
with a very, very low hit rate of success. When somebody needed a comment on something,
all the winners are out there fucking the prom queen and driving around their Ferraris, while
these guys are able to answer the phone and go "Oh yeah, I can give you an opinion on
that", because they're just sitting with their thumb up their ass with nothing better to do.
That's why I believe why we have such a low quality of thought leaders in America. It's
because you got to have low standards to be around to answer the call to get the job.

Nash Equilibrium

Maybe that concept of not everyone being able to do a thing is Nash Equilibrium.

"A stable state of a system involving the interaction of different participants, in which no
participant can gain by a unilateral change of strategy if the strategies of the others remain
unchanged."

Relationships

You make your destiny

There is no giant conscious 3rd person eye fucking your relationships to make sure they
meet their needs for what they want to see happen in the world, and thus fulfill the
"destiny" they have created for you.

In fact, there's not a single entity out there trying to achieve to some state of the universe
that has you with a single other person. In fact, your destiny is created by two people, you
and your lover. You both create each other's destiny through will and practice, and there
need not be any third voyeur whose objectives are more important than your own.

Your vision of the future and your ability to create it with the people you love is the highest
and best destiny this world will know.

Pickup

Great game means more flakes

If they don't flake, you will. When your game is really tight, you're going to end up
sleeping with lots of people you wouldn't normally get along with. This means less
second dates, because when the magic wears off, you’ll get a lot more flakiness. You’ll
be flaky too; everything was wonderful and you were super interested, now you really
don't care much. Or, you've learned to really not care much, because the glue that
would normal cause continued interaction, either the workplace, or really similar
outlooks on life or habits, probably isn't there. What was there was beauty, and in a
world of not too many good leads, beauty Is usually enough.

Some loves are better than others




When a crazy person loves you, they might think that killing your dog is doing you a favor so
you don't have to watch them die slowly one day of old age.

It's the same from your perspective as well, the amount of love you show someone is
probably more variable than you know, based on how you think they're treating you
perhaps. Thus, when people use suitcase word such as love, it kind of leaves out the
measuring of the strength, the quality. Not all cheeseburgers are the same either.

Getting to know others
Dunbar's number

Dunbar Number (150-250 people useful social group)

You can tell where someone is from by the words they use

The app that tells you where you're from by your answers to it. Influence / regional /
interesting (if you use the word cupboard instead of cabinet, or soda pop, etc.)
Managing Expectations

People come up to me

People come up to me because I dress interesting and I'm with beautiful people, but I
wouldn't be probably considered to be so beautiful myself, could lose ten kilos.
Anyway, people that approach me, you're always curious of what their motive is. Do
you just want to meet people who dress nice or are you curious, like is it the best
outcome for you to satisfy your curiosity of what is this interesting thing I've ever seen
before? Are you looking for funding and you think that I have money? Everyone's got
an angle.

I was teaching this idea of switching your but's to and's, and you're going to get much
more compliance, you're going to be much more friendly, you're going to make the
same points and say the same shit, so if you're going to make the same points except
have more impact and make more friends, you should definitely do that and that's
what switching but's to and's and honoring intention does.

The story would have told you about how I actually fucked up and just like crushed
someone that didn't need crushing. I don't like it sometimes when people say stupid
shit to me that I don't agree with me, and I feel like this telling them "No what you just
said is stupid, here's all the reasons why and their response to that is usually like "Oh, I
have to go" because they don't have anywhere to go within the conversation. They
don't have a good counterpoint they came with their hundred percent best move first.
And everything after that was like not good. Xx Revise paragraph

That whole thing was like basically about how you should use trainer tricks. You
should use positively framed language to garner attention, look cool and hang out
with cool people, and then out-going social people will say hello and meet you. The
vast majority of human productivity is performed by humans themselves and
machines. The humans are organized by corporate structures, the machines are
organized by corporate structures. Most of the humans and most of the machines are
not owned by governments, therefore because the government does not own or
control most of the humans, nor only control most of the machines, indeed
governments themselves produce jack shit compared to the private industries that
own, control and produce all of the stuff and the services. How many government-
owned musicians are there?



I am unaware of any in the western world, maybe there are some government
musicians in some smaller shittier countries with vastly shittier domestic outputs. The
knowledge I came up with, one showing you the governments aren't that powerful
and if you want government to save you, what you really want is the government to
get the fuck out of the way or set the game up as a referee, not as a player, but as a
referee to allow the players to do what they do best, better. Good referees exist and
where they exist, they allow the players to do what it is that they do better and I see
governments more of a referee than a competitor.

If you are a minimalist, you'll be happy changing your attitude

The point that I'm making is, if you are minimalist about what you really care about in
a lover, friend, an employee or even yourself, then you're going to find a lot more
happiness in life, because you're going to greatly increase the available parties that
you can interact with. That brings you joy and happiness. If you think that no one
deserves to be your friend unless they are heads of state and in charge of a country,
you're kind of screwed because it's very hard to hang out with those people. They
change every four years depending on what country you live. They have reasons to
not be truthful and their friendship towards you does to trade disputes or keeping the
people that vote for them happy.

Wouldn't you be much better served by not requiring your friends to be heads of
state? Or have IQ's over two hundred or be world champions of some sort. The more
restrictive, and I will say twatty, you are about the requirements that you have to feel
happiness with a person in your life, the harder it will be for you to have that.
Consequently as a side effect, not only will be harder to get that, but it will be harder
to keep.

You see the same thing with people. The more artificially, the more restrictive you are
with what requirements must be met in order for you to find happiness in a partner,
the less happiness will you have. By the way, this applies with employee that you
might want, or a company that you do business with, or yourself. If you have a rule
that you can only be happy with yourself when you have had snow zero days for
hundred days in a row, you have a body fat of 15 percent, you're the strongest you've
ever - you can have a rough time.

The more you compound that, the harder you make it. It's like adding extra locks to a
door. Now the door to happiness for you has twenty locks on it instead of one. Which
is more likely for you to get into your house in a reasonable time frame, the door with
twenty locks of twenty different keys, or the door with one lock and one key? How
you know how often you need to go in that door? How much overhead are you willing
to have in your life to meet the standard that you and only you is responsible for in
the end? It will be more accurate that there's lots of people responsible for it, but you
have the most influence over it. We might as well say "you and only you", but really in
reality we mean even if you happened to inherit or adopt some bad beliefs in regards
to what must happen in order for you to be happy, you have the power to change as
well as you have the power to say you know it's totally fair for me to feel good if this
level get set right. I've talked about it in relationships and how there's a side effect of
you being overly picky means that not only want you ever get it, but you won't be able



to keep it, because the other person has so many options. They're harder to get,
they're harder to keep. As you lower the requirements for what you need to be
happy, not only does it become easier to get what you want, but they're going to
make you happier.

Very closely related to this, by the way, is not only can you choose a standard by
which you hold the other people in your life to, but also the standards you hold
yourself to. You can also change the rate at which you measure whether people are
meeting those standards. That rate and the frequency at which, I hope you have a
frequency. You have to do things at least twice to have a frequency. Things
deteriorate over time, normally. You might have started with a good relationship.

Your relationship now might be a piece of crap, but you just never noticed because
you're busy at work or doing something else. By the way, if you didn't notice that your
relationship turns to crap, you're a bad partner, because it means you're not focusing
on important things to a relationship. If you're not bringing joy, happiness, importance
and security to your partner and that's not on your list of things that you're focused
on, and that's the reason that you didn't notice those things weren't happening for
them or for you, you're a bad partner. You play catch even though you're not really
playing catch. You're just playing catch with yourself, that's not the highest and best
relationship to have. Maybe make it a ritual; how's my relationship doing? There's
some I should be doing better.

Friends

Negative peer group

Don't train negative, don't game idiots and assholes. If you're coming up with a list of
bullshit to tell people you meet, because the truth is too scary for them, find a better
group of people. Really try to find that more empowering group instead of training to
be less than your best self.

When you're doing better than someone else, and you let them discover it, to some
degree, they will hate you. Only the very, very rare and most advanced man can
actually find joy in someone else's superiority to them, in a trait they have that they're
proud of.

Being around people

The Richard number: the ratio of hanging out with people noise to smell level in an
enclosed environment. Monkeys are the worst.

Stress testing

Won the lottery? Ask all your friends to borrow some money and help you move.
Defriend the losers before you let anyone you know you won. If you've got real balls,
never let anyone know.

Friends

Does everyone have a good trait? Most people do. If you're creative, intelligent and
sincere you can find it, and give them a truly beautiful compliment. You actually have
to know them, though.

As you advance in this world, you realize that one of the quickest ways to get rid of a
friend is to lend him more money than he can repay. What option does he have? To
do something that's very, very hard, get rid of his free time, try and find some type of
gainful employment that he's comfortable doing, to pay you back, or to imagine that



you're actually not such a nice guy, you're actually an asshole and you don't deserve
to get paid back. Which of those two things is easier? Now you've lost the money and
the friend.

What you learn as you advance on this planet is, if you want to keep your friends, you
can give them money. By the way, they hate that too. They grow animosity for that as
well, because you're stealing their dignity from them. Everyone wants to have pride in
themselves, everyone wants to be self-sustaining, nobody wants to be a leech of a
sycophant, and for you to pay for people's things, subconsciously, it harms them. It
literally harms them. Very few people, very, very few people, can genuinely appreciate
a gift and not, to some degree, feel like they have to retaliate.

Employees are better than friends

Employees are better than friends

Employees are worth more than friends. If you're in a house, it's unlikely that it was
built by friends of any sort. It's likely that it was built by employees, because
employees do what you tell them to do in exchange for you giving them a lot of value
in return, that you had to earn previously as well. That exchange of value for value, or
money for labor. If I pay someone to paint something and then in return I paint for
them, then it's like a proxy.

The reason employees always work out so well is because functionally, it's the same
as you doing it yourself, so by that token employees are more important than friends.
I'll give you some more ideas as to why that's the case. How many friends do you have
that are actually good friends? 6? 8? I guess it depends, if you can build one and not
communicate very much, but still maintain friend status. I don't think it's more than
20. On the other hand, as far as employees go, you can have a whole lot more than
20, you shouldn't limit yourself to progress that only 20 people could provide you
when you could have hundreds or thousands. Wouldn't you be surprised if there were
companies out there that had hundreds of thousands? Maybe Walmart does. Xx Milla
addition: might mention Chinese company (or maybe companies?) that have millions
of employees

Pride

Pride maximization, let people do shit for themselves.

Scaling with other people

Scaling with other people

No learning, no talking to single individuals when you can create a framework that can
allow other people to do it. Write a spec, enforce it, have an enforcer, then you're no
longer limited by your hours. You're limited by your money and other people's hours.
Your ability to choose the right people and enforce that they are actually getting the
things done. Don't teach, don't absorb more info, you have done enough of that. Scale
through other people's hours. That way when balls are dropped, you aren't left there
feeling like shit.

Let's take a look at Bill Gates, is on and off sometimes, the richest person in the world.
Even if he wasn't he's still on top one percent of anyone that's ever existed in the
history of mankind. And if you took his wealth and compared it to the ten people close
to him they would shit on him. Because how fucking rich you are, ten people that are
in your peer group will shit on you. Wow, well that's interesting, so, wouldn't it be



smarter to convince these ten people that have more than you will ever have, no
matter how hard you could ever fucking possibly work or how much luck you ever
possibly got, wouldn't it be smarter, to let those ideas that so influenced you and
invigorated you, influence those that combined are far greater that you could ever be,
yes! And that's why he does it. That's why Bill Gates doesn't just do his own thing, Bill
Gates has the giving pledge, which attracts other billionaires and multi-millionaires to
give huge portions of their wealth away, sooner rather than later, to things that they
believe in.

A lot the smart people think that the solutions to the problems that they have are
themselves. They think if they take the right nootropics, if they work harder, if they
put more hours in, that’s going to get them to where they want to be. Truth of the
matter is, you yourself don’t scale, you can't do ten times as much work. If you could
do ten times as much work, you could only do it once. But when you use other people,
when you use the power of the Internet, when you use the power of machines, when
you have machines and other human beings helping you do things you don’t just get a
single lOx benefit. You can get it over and over and over again, because the rest of the
world scales, you don't. All those things that you do, trying to drug yourself and do
uber-man method sleep experiments, when they fuck up, you have down time. Find
the machines, people and systems that can scale in ways that you can't, and do things
that you can't.

I think that’s the same type of holistic thinking that leads you away from trying to
extract performance out of yourself, and towards extracting performance out of other
people. How do you become less important to the organization because you've done
such a good job hiring? How do you become less important to your unhappiness,
because you've surrounded yourself with the right systems, and habits and people.

The joy is nearly effortless. No hard busting of ass on your own.

The art of taking advice from losers

Do losers have good ideas - yes they do. Can you learn from losers? Yes, you can. The
trick is to know whether this loser is offering you advice that he himself has taken, or
he's offering you the advice that he could never use himself. That's the magic.

Stopped clocks are right twice a day and losers are often right too. The magic is
checking to see if the loser's advice is given intelligently elsewhere. A quorum. A fancy
word for getting a few different opinions on a thing and seeing if there’s a consensus
(fancy word for agreement).

It seems like the best books on success are never written by the most successful
people, the best books on relationships are never written by the people with the best
relationships and the best books on happiness are never written by the happiest
people. It also seems that the best sports coaches are never the best players. For that
reason, I'm willing to give some leeway.

Family

Child support/alimony

Kids don't get any more money after 18, but if you get a divorce, your ex gets paid
forever. Not the same 18 kids get, but forever. Why? Because fuck you slave. That's
why.

Son of a builder



I like the son of an idea builder much more than I like the son of author. Who has ever
seen an author? Who would ever want to see one again?

Family

Now this is one of those situations, and the reason that I bring it up is, in a world
where everyone's playing a slightly different video game, the intuitive solutions that
you have, they sometimes are the worst things you can do. Oh, my family member
needs money. Let me lend it to them. He'll pay me back. Oh, I've never heard from my
family member again, and now they tell anyone that'll listen that I'm a piece of shit
because they owe me money. Oops. I didn't get that memo, that that's actually the
wrong way to handle giving money to family.

Give it to them? Or get a collateral upfront, or don't give it to them? Or, give it to
them and make sure they pay it back? But if you're giving and they can't pay it back,
you probably just lost a good relationship. You paid for the privilege of making them a
worse person. They don't teach you that shit in most schools, and it's really important
to learn. You could call that wisdom. Why don't they have a class called wisdom? It
would be doable. Maybe this is that class.

Children

Birth control, choosing comfort over the future of humanity

Because contraceptives are effective, eventually the world will have selected
through evolution for people that actually want to have kids as opposed to just
try and have kids through having sex. Contraceptive effectiveness makes just
fucking not create kids anymore where as people who want to have kids actually
have them. Few hundred years from now you're going to see a lot of those
people that wanted to have kids - or we're just bad at using contraceptives.

If your biology affects your society, and over time, your society actually affects
your biology. Guys today keep opting for big boobs. That keeps happening.
People are going to bigger boobs, because heredity exists, that's the selection
pressure. We had biology that affected our society, and now our society affects
our biology. If you need to take care of your child for years so it can survive on
its own, then you can do more programming through nurture and less
programming through nature because you have the time to do so.

It's easy to discount all of the things that lead to children as things that you
don't care about and that you are not focused on. It's also important to
understand that the reason you get to play in this game is because it's very likely
that your parents had sex, probably more than once, and were either bad at
using condoms, or were told that mommy couldn't get pregnant, or they
actually wanted to have a kid. I would have to imagine it is not the most
common outcome, I think most guys that have sex do it for the joy, and would
prefer that kids not come out of it.

What we have now is a disagreement, a misalignment of desires between the
system that allowed us to exist and the future. If 10k years from now we
compared what was left over from you assuming you were not still around
(which is a pretty good bet), no one has lived that long yet so it's unlikely that
you will be the first. What's more likely to be around, your genes, offspring, or a



building that you built. It turns out, buildings crumble, and we don't have any
10k year old buildings around here. All the things in this world that you can
literally build with your own hands, energy, time. A child is the most likely thing
that will take parts of you and take it into the future.

Your offspring will look like you and operate like you, if you were there to raise
them, even if you were not. Nature matters, so does nurture, but if you didn't
have the nurture the nature would still matter, so now we live our lives trying to
optimize for ourselves greedily at the cost at the future, and I'm almost okay
with that trade. I'm almost okay with the next 10k years having a little more
suck, if there's a chance that I can have a better life now. Is it greedy? Yes, by
definition it is, for the same reason you don't let a bunch of strangers in your
house, and you don't let them into your wallet. In this world of limited
resources, that which preceded me has engrained in me the value of choosing
self over others, family over others, kin over others, friends and team mates
over others. Anyone of you that decides that you are going to try and shift that
paradigm and do a different thing, you will be selected against and you will be
removed from competition. You will not have offspring and your offspring may
not survive because you tried to be smarter than the system that brought you
into this world.

What's right for the future is wrong for us, and what's wrong for the future is
right for us from a short-term, midterm personal development; do you care
about money, do you care about excellence in areas that are not producing
kids? If you do, producing kids is going eat up a lot of your time, and yes, it's
going to give you fulfillment that you couldn't otherwise get, and yes, mid to
long term it's going to pay off great, but it is still a trade.



Lovers (Romantic)

Game

Choose your hunting ground
Ratios

The ratios in the Gold Coast are totally fucked, because guys can't put on
muscle and girls have a harder time fixing face.

Game Mechanics

Don't open moving sets







For those of you out there that are doing street game, day game, night
game, nightclub game etc., if you followed my advice, you wouldn't be
opening moving sets, because they suck. Thus, if you're not opening
moving sets, then there's no reason for you to spend a lot of time in
transition. Get on your fucking bicycle, or jog, or whatever you thing is,
get the fuck out of transition and get into the club. Bicycle is the shit.

Text game

Getting dates after good texting

Burn your value for a friend

If you're ever looking for some game theory strategy to burn all of your personal
value, and give it to someone else - let's say some girl really likes you, but you're
already occupied. You want to try and shift that girl's interest to your friend,
who's worthy of it, and she just needs to switch, because it works out better for
everybody. You could say "Hey, come over to my friend's house, it's really
important that you act cool though, don't fuck this up for me." That phrase,
"Don't fuck this up for me" one hundred percent burns all of your value, and
gives it to that other person, so it's an interesting tactic.

Jealousy

Signaling mechanism

Game theory / alignment

People hate from a distance, but love if they think they can align with you.
There's nothing as cringe worthy as losers that are arrogant. I once saw a fat,
balding man in a pickup class go up to a hot bartender, ask for a pen, then tell
her to write her phone number down. People that lie to sew, I'd see how they
can get away with it. Xx HOW VILECHECK my old as documents for book
material.

In the Internet, they call it being dragged down to his level and getting beat with
experience, that's the definition of why you don't argue with trolls on the
Internet. They will drag you down to their level and they will beat you with
experience. It's like wrestling a pig in the mud. You don't like it, but the pig
thinks it's fun. In summary, if you want to have a better time of life, try not to
always seem right. Nobody likes it, nobody will pay you for it, a very small
subset of people in this world that are actually able to make money on being
right and the less cunty you are about it, the more of a positive impact that
you're going to make in the world. This is because other people take the other
side of the equation, even if they're wrong, just to not be on your side because
you may have a personality, which is so off-putting.

Player hating. Everyone likes to feel important and intelligent. One path to
obtaining this goal is to find unique or novel opinions or angles that others
haven't expressed, and express them yourself. If you are amongst good



company, and they notice, you should derive benefit. There is a common and
unfortunate side effect to this behavior of being novel, as some in their hunt for
importance become nit pickers. Nit pickers don't bring meaningful contribution
to a conversation, as they're too busy pointing out the obvious exceptions that
everyone else already knows about, and purposely didn't mention as they were
under the assumption that everyone else already know those exceptions existed
without needing to mention them. For instance "but Richard, surely some nit
pickers bring meaningful contributions.." "Sure you don't mean all the nit
pickers..."

A wonderful discovery - when people say "everyone", what they almost always
mean is "almost everyone." Exception hunting is the weakest and I'd say most
time wasting way to try to add to a conversation. Unless the exception you've
pointed out is hard to see, please don't insult the intellect of those you are
speaking with by pointing out the obvious.

Vanity or player hating because of difficulty to extract significance from the
person - hard to find synergy. The reason people hate vanity and hate conceited
people, is because it's harder to extract significance from them, and harder to
extract love from them. It is because of their heightened effort and status on
themselves that they give less of a fuck about you, and therefore it's harder to
find synergy with them.

The problem with game is that it doesn't fix the shitty people you're gaming.
Delay forever, if possible, what it is that you do, for no matter how great your
reality is, it won't match up to their imagination.

Shit testing

Women test for strength. The man that can actually save them is the man that
can actually hurt them. It's good for them to sense that strength, maybe
through lifting them up, maybe through them conquering another man in front
of them. Check out the covers of all the romance novels; jacked dudes with
pants half unzipped, towering above the woman they are carrying. All the
covers are identical - long hair, glistening body, stronger and taller than the
woman, with a mountainous background, looking at the woman, sometimes not
holding or caring too much, and other times, obviously in love. If you are
optimizing your identity for people with this type of taste, I can imagine you're
doing yourself harm.

Do you see the romance cover where the man is smart, or funny, or doing
something useful like building something, or is leading other men? Nope, hell,







even modernity? Why are they all set somewhere that is surely not the world
we live in?

Mind you, not all women like these books, however, I think you'll find it odd that
there is literally no male version of this. Can you imagine if there was a male
version of a romance novel with half naked women on the front on their knees,
on a chain? Maybe pornography magazines are the male version, maybe Hustler
and Playboy are male romance novels? Hell, maybe they're worse. The women
have no traits at all except nudity.

Value

Guys that focus on getting women instead of becoming more powerful, shirk
their responsibility and the very thing that the women are selecting for. If you
spend your time not focusing on a woman and developing the traits that they
select for, then against your best efforts, they're going to hunt you out, find you
and choose you over other people, but if you're a man that's always searching
and hunting and turning through leads, that activity makes you less valuable,
less useful to the other party, and if it's not easy enough to visualize, then you
could invert it and see it from their perspective. What would a woman appear to
be to you, if all they did was sacrifice what you were selecting for? What if they
got uglier and uglier the more they went out from lack of sleep and consuming
too much alcohol? Then you would look at them like they were idiots, because
they sacrificed what you were selecting for, which was beauty.

Attraction isn't a choice, vanity is love

"If attraction isn't a choice, then vanity is love". When you are at the gym, you
are actually having sex with yourself, but wait, that doesn't make any sense? Yes
it does, because whatever development you get there, some other partner will
eventually notice and choose you for that, and may not have picked you for if
you didn't have that progress. Therefore, when you are improving yourself and
working out, mentally, physically, financially, you are actually having sex with
yourself through proxy that actually hasn't detected the improvement yet, but
will when given the chance. Anytime you are improving yourself you are getting
laid, but just into the future.

It's just like Bitcoin

It's just like Bitcoin. We burn electricity to prove that we really cared to create
this answer, it really took time and therefore it is not fake. If you don't do the
burning, then you don't prove the caring. You don't prove the effort. That's why
women want real wedding rings. They may not want the real wedding ring,
because the of sparkle. What's important is that it cost you, because you can
fake words, you can fake some actions, but I'll be damned if you fake a year of
work to buy a girl a thing. They've used that and I also believe they use being
horrible during periods as a way to find out how safe you really are and how
much you really care. It's a way to tell that if we have a kid, and that kid's a
crying mess, I'm a crying mess and everything sucks, that you're still going to be
here -1 have to give you some pre suck to make sure that you're really there.
What's easier? To get naggy when you get cramps, and therefore cause pain to
those around you retributively as though the person talking to you is the person
who is hurting you. We tend to treat other people as a source of our pain even
though they're not, because in the past, they used to be enough that you're



better off just assuming that whatever's hurting you will respond to you yelling
at it.

Shit I care about

If I say I love my wife, she wants to talk to me for an hour after work about the
dumb shit that happened there and the gossip that I don't understand or care
about, and I have to listen and love it and enjoy it because I'm a good husband.
She needs to feel important and I need to listen to what's important to her.
When I'm talking about writing a book or shit she doesn't care about, I expect
her to be a good wife and listen to what I'm passionate about, even if she
doesn't give a fuck.

Women love drama

Women need and love drama and if there’s not drama in their life, they are
going to invent it. You have a choice as a man. Do you want to fill your woman
and give her what she desperately needs by inventing risk free drama? That is
contrived and actually not that big a deal, or do you want them to experiment
with bringing that drama? They're not optimizing for risk-freeness and you're
going to have problems. Either you can bring them to the table or they can bring
them to the table. If you're a smart guy and you know how to use your brain the
right way, you're probably going to create a much better and higher class of
problem than the stuff that they could bring.

Stress testing relationships

Women stress test their relationships for excellence, the same way that
government stress test banks and that factories stress test backup generators.
You need to see what things do when the shit hits the fan, so that when the shit
actually hits the fan, you're safe. If you're a woman, the shit hitting the fan for
you is getting pregnant and not being able to work a job for nine months or
some period thereof, having to feed and take care of this child and work on
reduced sleep, even endure pain and risk of injury. Giving kids isn't that easy,
you might get injured on the deal. How would you make sure that your support
network, your backup generators that are your loved one, husband, family,
would be there for you when the shit hits the fan?





The worst way to discover your security would be to just dive right in and not do
any pre-testing and hope it all works out. A smarter way, a way that I feel has
evolved over time to result in these weird behaviors from women that we don't
understand is because we don't see their value. What I have discovered is that if
you're horrible once a month because you're in pain, because you're having
your period, then once a month, you're pre-testing the desire and ability for
those that you interact with, your loved ones, their ability to put up with terror
and horror and stuff. The more easily, and with a smile on their face, they deal
with you at your worst, then the more safe and secure you should be in your
belief that when you need them the most, when you are your weakest that they
will be there for you. If you didn't have monthly stress testing through
emotional unfairness from the pain and discomfort of a period, then, I don't
know how else you would ritualize the fitness testing of your support network.

In order to know that you had the right guy that would be there for you when
you were pregnant and that you're weakest and needed someone else the
most, what's one of the most unique things about this is to understand that
when a woman appears to be only happy once your psychology has been
destroyed. Once you have been in a rage to the point where you can't breathe,
once your day has been ruined by whatever method they have chosen of either
nagging about things you haven't done, telling you that some other guy was
better, telling you that you're a loser, that you don't listen and you don't do
things right and you'll never be anything, or whatever strategy they happen to
pick to want to destroy you. You think that there's a way to strategize your way
out of that, you think that if you behave different they would stop doing that
because you don't realize why they're doing it.

They're not doing it to be true to some external standard of truth regarding
whether you suck as a human being or not, they're doing it to fill an unconscious
drive to see you tortured and in pain - and still stay and love them. That is what
they subconsciously want to see, that they can torture you and you will still be
there. There's an art to allowing yourself to be tortured and love them
unconditionally, while having the value that you have other options, you are a
prize and she is lucky to have you. If she didn't have you, someone would
rapidly replace her and love to trade spots with her. You need both.

She needs to know that she just barely has you because you're close to being
out of her league. You're just in her league enough that she can act horrible and
you'll still be there for her, and to find that line is really hard, because you don't
know what she thinks her league is. You don't know what she thinks are your
best qualities, and those change by time. Sometimes they want you to be
dominant. Sometimes they want you to be loving and caring and sensitive. Good
luck accurately dispensing those vibes and methods of being, to end up with a
higher and greater experience of love and caring in a relationship and
connection between a man and a woman. It is not easy. And if it was easy, it
probably wouldn't be fun.

What do you care about in a woman?



Does she smell good? Will she be a good mom? Is she fun sensually? Is she
happy? Is she flexible, does she make you feel important? Is she honest? Does
she have good taste? Her taste is going to influence what your house looks like,
her opinion of you, what you wear and friends. Her friend's problems are going
to be your problems. Her taste in a work environment, her problems at work are
going to be your problems. These are some of the things, maybe even most of
the things that I care about in a lover and a life partner. I could add to that list a
lot of things that I could tell you are important, however, all it would do is
reduce the number of people in the world that you could fall in love with and
have an amazing time with. Most people think that this concept of a soul mate
exists, that for some reason there’s just one other person out there for you and
lucky you, they live near you so you’ll find them. They speak the language you
speak. They have similar beliefs and it turns out that there are actually a lot of
people that you can have a good relationship with.

Sex with multiple partners and desire versus time theory, the time value of lovers

If it is true that all relationships come to an end (which in the longest case is by
death), then it is also true that relationships that are older have less time left in
them. Therefore, the case can be made that a relationship that is nearing the
average death point (7 years declared, probably 5.5 years where the fun stops)
does not have much time in it. Then if a relationship has met a certain threshold
of length, say 4 months, then a 5 month old relationship can be logically said to
be worth more for keeping well-functioning than a relationship that is 4.5 years
old.

The 5 month relationship is statistically more likely to last a couple more good
years than the older relationship is. Sadly, our emotions aren't programmed so
strictly to optimize for happiness years. There are also other social implications
to who you relate to, and when, and how relationships start and end, that are
outside the optimization for gross total happiness days. The counterintuitive
discovery is that you are likely better off finding a new good relationship in
today's environment than fixing a broken and aging one. Feels bad, however, it's
what works.

Should we be with different people? Is the sex just not as good as it should be
because we're bored of it and that is normal? That happens. It's very normal, it
happens. People don't want to eat steak seven times a week. They can stake
over a lifetime. Maybe you need to rate limit how often your act with the
person, or maybe you need to switch people, or maybe they change so much
they can do better than you now. Maybe you change so much you can do better
than them now. Better actually exists. You can actually upgrade your partner, it
is actually a thing people are programmed to say and pretend that they don't
think that can happen. It's actually a program falsehood, you want people to
feel more secure than they should be and that you'll never leave them, because
you think you'll get more performance out of them if they don't think you'll
never leave them. You're scared that if they think you might leave them that
they see it too risky. You know them, I think that you can leave them no matter
what and then it's too risky to interact with you. I believe in honesty, I like
honesty, honesty feels great. Be honest if someone is not up to your standards



any more, tell them; You are going to up your game or we're switching. That's
what's up and let's not pretend.

If my game gets too bad, you're going to do the same thing. You just find a fancy
excuse for it. It's like people that don't have prenuptial agreements, they get
divorces. The reason is if you give someone a million dollar reward for thinking
you're not funny or cool to hang out with anymore, let me tell you, for a million
dollars it's very easy for people to fall out of love with you, for a million dollars
it's very easy for people to think that you're just not that cool anymore. You
could be the funniest guy in the world, if there's a million dollars payoff for not
laughing at your jokes that million dollars are going to get paid. Don't structure
the underlying agreements and mutual beliefs, in a way where the parties have
a reason to break up.

I would be willing to state that the financial and social penalties that exist for
risky, low reward, high potential damage things that exist in the criminal world
perhaps should exist in the social world. Maybe that's why guys and girls react
so violently when they discover their partner was cheating. This might be
because of the biological perspective - in the old days, there was no genetic
testing. If a woman had a kid and that kid wasn't yours but you thought it was
now, you are permanently eliminated from the gene pool of the future of
humanity, unless you have another kid with her that just happens to be yours,
you have another partner or you donate sperm to a sperm bank and someone
actually uses it. Unless one of those three options become true, you are
permanently eliminated from the gene pool. Therefore, we have evolved and
been rewarded for being violently pair bondish and literally violently defensive
of a pair bond between two lovers, because perhaps those people that were
cool with polygamy just got opted out of survival. They didn't end up having
enough kids of their own. After time passed, the people that had a more
effective strategy for promoting their genes into the future by having partners
that were monogamous with them. Another strategy, you could be the guy that
gets all the girls to cheat with you, I guess you could do that too.

Mate status signaling

Jimmy Fallon fell down and ripped his finger off, that's the downside to wearing
rings. The upside is fitness for mating signaling. You got to choose. Keep a
finger? Or keep a mate. They make nice silicon rings that tear before your finger
does as well.

Can you think of a stupider way to decide which girls you like, or be influenced
by, such as hair color? The most commonly changed and inaccurate thing? Like,

I choose to like things based on the fakest thing possible.

Regarding hair color, if you believe that we have sex to create kids, and you
believe that we select certain traits, that historically have created better kids,
for instance, more caring women, more muscular dudes, smarter funnier dudes,
if that’s what you've been selected for, which is why we see the changes that we
do in areas of comedy, areas of interests, if you say the society chooses how a
kid turns out, then why is it that young gay kids like what girls like?



Did the society teach them that young gay kids were like that? No. Because they
don't have a reference for how young gay kids are supposed to act. It's never
been advertised to them. Young gay kids do not act young and feminine,
because they were advertised that lifestyle. They act that way because when
your body is growing up, the difference between turning out guy and turning
out a girl isn't that big. Signaling exists to give you the only clues you can have
since you can't scan DNA yourself.

Gambling and thrill and adventure are supposed to pay you positive dividends.
You're supposed to be able to find resources that other people wouldn't find.
You're supposed to demonstrate traits of durability and power, because you
have so much extra resources to spend on leisure and adventure, that potential
partners recognize that, and are signaled towards that, instead of those mates
that weren't so bad ass that they didn't have the extra resources. It's probably
the reason girls have bigger tits than they need, because they don't need bigger
tits.

Aesthetic is so very important now, to the point where women put, literally,
hours a day every day reapplying the lie that is the fake hair, fake make up, fake
lotion, fake tan, fake everything. Everything's fake, because competitive market,
and everyone out there is fake, so you got to be fake too. God damn. That's like,
25% of the work day lying to everybody, which I think is pretty funny when they
complain about when guys lie to them. Guys shouldn't lie, but at least
understand that you lie too, like, there's not a lot of real going on here. Every
day is not your prom night. "Oh look, lips that are too red. Tits that are too big.
Look they stand on their fucking own, they basically have their own legs, great."

I fall for all that shit.

It's not fair that half of the population of the planet spends 25% of their waking
hours doing something that's destroyed when they go to sleep. Guys can be
more beautiful too, we can, and we're just not willing to pay that price. It is not
worth that much. If it took two hours in the morning for me to look 20 % better,
fuck that. I don't need to look that much better for two goddamn hours. I'm not
sure where that number is. For me? Maybe it's 15 minutes, maybe it's 20
minutes.

Past that, dude. You need a better friend circle, or you need to get a soul mate
and stop trying to hunt a new one. It's called vanity overhead. What's your
vanity overhead? How much time do you waste sending out signals, that no one
gives a fuck about. I don't know. You're not curing cancer. You're barely making
kids, I don't know what you're doing with that shit. You're looking to good, far
too good. Far too much social media, but you're not making money on this.
You're not making any money on social media. Stop spending your whole life on
it. Read a book.

Sex is a great way to create variety and select for useful shit. Seems to amplify
the diversity rate, which amplifies the chance that something good happens,



which amplifies the rate at which robustness occurs. It also amplifies the fuck
up's that we get from things that didn't work out, but it's a small price to pay for
being not extinct, I guess. The rate at which you can adapt is super important.
Studies have been done on how important the rate you adapt is, and from what
I remember, it's super important. Changing is not enough. Changing fast is more
important. In a world full of fake hair, fake nails, fake eyebrows, fake eyelashes,
Botox, fake tits, fake lips, holy shit, that's before the science kicks in. Is this a
useful way to choose a partner, on how good they are at making a fake person
out of themselves? How attractive is your fake person that is not you? How
attractive are all the traits that you don't have that you pretend to have? Is that
good for the world, or is that destroying otherwise useful signaling mechanisms
that used to be valuable in telling who was more fit, who was less fit, for
reproductive activity?

If you want to know why all this trivial knowledge isn't actual trivial is because
every single man and every single woman is very likely to run into this problem
of not getting along with each other for reasons they don't really understand. I
think if you honor the intention of being terrible every once in a while as a stress
test, then two things will happen. One, you'll be happier during a stress test
because you know there's a pot positive benefit at the end, and two, if for some
reason you didn't have any stress testing, you might want to invent some on
your own that are fair and balanced, if you care about you know not having the
volatility of relying on someone who's not reliable, or thinking someone is there
for you when they're really not. That type of person with those kinds of options
looks at you and goes "Oh! I could do better." It's like trying to date a girl that
works at a restaurant a bar. They get hit on two hundred million times a day.

You come with your normal human being game and trying game a professional
who gets hit on all day long, and you realize that she doesn't give a damn about
what you're saying because she's heard that same thing one hundred different
times, so you don't get to use the strategy. To attract them you have to have
some other thing, and those other things are harder.

A lot of people that you know love to have sensuality with multiple partners.
Guys in particular, guys that want to have multiple girls as partners, they get
pissed off when of musician or a rich person gets a lot of attraction and a lot of
sensuality without putting in the same work that they did and it's funny when
you think about it because they actually put in more work for longer, at a harder
task and through that got what you tried to find the other way.

Guys will try and seem like they have more money than they do. As a strategy,
guys will try and seem more interesting popular than they are, because it's
easier to pretend to be popular, rich and interesting than it is to actually be
popular or rich or interesting. You see this in the animal kingdom too. There are
animals that are actually poisonous, and then there are other animals that look
almost identical to them that aren't poisonous. It's funny because they both get
the result of being treated with the respect that poisonous animals do,
however, only one of them is actually poisonous.



This is something I've told my friends for years but hasn't made the book yet;
people that are more willing to experiment physically at risk for an emotional
gain are more willing to be sensual with you for fun. They're more willing to risk
STDs or the fact that you're some kind of crazy psycho, but they might be able
to have a fun sexual time. How might you know who these people are? Well, is
their hair colored a funny color? I don't like that one very much, by the way,
because the type of person that I am doesn't get along so well with those types
of people. They detect that I don't actually like the same shit that they like. I do
well with people that respect power, money, goals, future, you know,
performance oriented people that usually form their family history came from a
performance oriented, professional, money style family.

A girl that's going to love me the most is going to be a girl who wants an
excellent financial future and the respect of the professional and perhaps
political people of the world. For the most part, artists would vomit if they
heard any of those words because that's gross. "Is that all you are, the stuff you
have? Is that all you are, the people you control? That's disgusting!" I
understand completely that mindset. Yes, that does sound kind of disgusting
when you frame it that way. When you frame it the way that the clothes that
you're wearing was created by companies, and the house that you're living in
was created by companies, and the drugs that you take to no get sick were
created by companies. You learn that companies actually have human beings
getting shit done so you should probably quit demonizing them because without
them, there'd be some warlords stepping on your neck right now and you'd be
doing what that guy said. Thus, back to the ventures of women or men.

People with tattoos, or that use drugs, or that smoke or do other risky painful
things personally that have pleasurable emotional results are more likely to
have sex with you because they've set the frame. "If she smokes, she pokes."
That's funny. There are probably a lot of other sayings; does a girl have a kid,
how'd she get that kid? Having sex. You know who's more likely to have sex? A
girl with a kid, instead of a girl that has a chastity belt on, an allergy to
relationships or doesn't like the gender that you are. You're going to find a lot of
that. You will meet people that do not want to have sex with anyone that is your
gender. Sometimes it's a girl, sometimes it's a guy and it's totally normal, and I
tell you, you probably feel the same way. If you don't feel that way, if you're
bisexual, multi sexual, poly sexual, whatever fancy word you use for being more
open with your sexuality. Do you fuck machines? Do you fuck people with
learning disabilities? I can keep moving this bar to some point where you find
you that yes indeed, there is something you don't want to have sex with, and
therefore you shouldn't be so hard on the rest of the world that just happens to
not want to have sex with you.

You're going to save yourself a lot of hatred, animosity and you're going to stop
punishing yourself for something that is actually healthy for the world and
something that you're doing and profiting from personally. Anytime you get
rejected by somebody and you want to take it personally, because it's probably
the most personal thing that there could possibly be, realize that you would be



doing the exact same rejection to millions of other people in the world if the
opportunity presented itself. It's going to take the edge off.

themselves and as a result, they get better quality women and put less time into doing
it, because they worked on their product development instead of sales.

Male-female relationships

If you designed male-female human relationships from scratch, you would make
sure that the best looking guys got the best looking girls, and the worst looking
people get the other worst looking people, more or less. It's pretty stupid to try
and achieve performance out there in the rest of the world, when there's so
much to be done at home, when you could work yourself to the top of your
game, and then you could get what you deserve.

Women

Women want diamonds

Women want diamonds because they fuck you over in your wallet. The same
reason when they're on their period they want you to suffer, it is how you weed
out the false believers in a social system. With a transaction cost, an entry fee.
Funny how that evolved. Prenup, are you million dollars funny?


Humor

If you ever want to impress a girl, pretend you're a cat holding down its milk
bowl with its V-shaped paw and trying to lick up all the milk.

Be loved

If you truly want to be loved, you've got two options. Search harder, to find someone
that loves you as you are. Or, improve who you are. Be more loveable.

Paper clip theory

Relationships - the paperclip bending theory of relationship strength.

Classification

You know I keep seeing all these advertisements for diversity and quotas and report cards.
Why are you classifying by race? Why don't you classify by stupid? How many stupid people
have you hired? Or how many rage filled people? Or how many depressed people? Or how
many people that always say the wrong thing? Why are you using race to select between
people? Doesn't that make you a racist? Isn't there some more important categorization
you can use for humans?

I think you're better off dividing people by profession, or you can divide them up by their
time. Some people act this way at work and act this way when they're not at work.

Driving tests. Do you think that everyone that turns sixteen should get a driver's license?
Obviously not, that's why we have tests. Do you think that only people that have turned
sixteen in the United States should be the only people that are allowed to take those tests? I
think that some people aren't ready at 20, and some people are ready at 12, because we
don't all develop at the same rate. We have diversity. We have the excellence, robustness
and the redundancy of multiple people with multiple growth strategies. Some people are
early bloomers, some people are late bloomers. Some people are good with hand/eye
coordination and driving, some people are idiot savants that can't ever drive anything ever,
but if you ask them when a Tuesday was a couple thousand years ago, they know the date.
Or vice versa, you tell them the date, they tell you which day of the week it was. There are
people that have mental ability and mental capacity in great excess, in a certain area,
because they have diminished capacity in another area. Now, is that to say that it's a zero-
sum game? Is that to say that you can only have intellect in an area if you become stupid
someplace else? No, definitely not. Because of the power of analogy, the more you
understand about the world in one area, the more you understand about the world in all the
other areas, as long as you learn how to apply the analogy and framework, as long as you
learn how to apply the framework somewhere else. It may not increase what they call in the
study of intelligence, your "Big G," your general intelligence, how well you do on an IQ test,
but you can have Big G without ever learning a language.

You can have Big G in intelligence without ever learning how to do anything. If you were
deprived of basically all enriching information, born on an island, just existed and didn't
have culture or have never heard a joke, never heard a song, you would still have the Big G
that you were born with. Let's see Big G for what it is: it's a useful metric to decide whether
there are some exercises that have good fall-over usefulness.

Giving / Reciprocity

Very few people, very, very few people, can genuinely appreciate a gift and not, to some
degree, feel like they have to retaliate. A properly programmed person is going to retaliate
with another awesome gift, and you've got a self-referencing, Christmas time, I love giving



gifts, they love giving gifts, everyone's happy, it's win for everybody. That's what gift giving
is. It's convincing you to do something for yourself, but the thing that you're doing for
yourself is that you're doing it for someone else. I'm too lazy to scratch my back, but I'll
scratch yours, and then you'll scratch mine because we believe in reciprocity. The end result
is you've got a scratched back and I've got a scratched back, but neither one of us would
have scratched our own out of laziness. The reason that gift giving exists in the world, and
the reason that credit is so powerful in the world is because it's the lubrication that causes
human beings to get motivated and do things that their otherwise lazy, monkey-brain,
calorie saving brain wouldn't engage in.

We need those heroes to go out there and run three minute miles, or whatever that crazy
number is for the super low time in which you can run a mile. I assure you, I've never come
close to running such a thing. We need those people that like to give gifts. We need those
people that like to make other people happy. We need those people who are willing to take
it on faith and give you credit, that they'll do a thing for you today, or give you a thing today,
because in the future they believe that you'll pull through and do the right thing. Without
those amplifiers, without those lubricants, things grind to a halt. No one does anything. It's a
tragedy that you see during times of depression that giant masses of intelligent, useful
people with access to resources are not able to overcome the resting friction of laziness, or
the difficulty of asset allocation. They're too greedy, they don't want to part with the thing
until it's paid for, because they're afraid they'll never get paid. Then if enough people do
that, nobody does anything anymore. Houses don't get built.

It's funny that when you ask people for respect and gratitude, they get first level benefit
from being grateful, they get the happiness. You get to watch the happiness, you're one
level removed. They got paid to generate it, and you had to pay to generate it. You had a
cost and they had a benefit. It's hilarious, it's something that costs them nothing, they
literally profit, no cost from it, from the impetus. Something that benefits them directly,
whereas you just get to watch them benefiting and derive some indirect benefit, has to be
begged for, it has to be fought for. How did that evolve? How did them turning down the
profit twice to direct any actual impetus cost evolve? I have no idea.

Thresholds / Testing (Org me better xx )

That concept of tipping points and thresholds is interesting, like the sayings "guests are like
fish, they begin to stink after three days." or "Wind to a relationship is like wind to a flame,
is like distance to a relationship: a small amount makes it stronger, and too much
extinguishes it." This whole concept thresholds exiting I find very interesting.

There’s a saying that you shouldn't test friends because they'll fail. Don't unfairly test
friends, or test them for no good, wholesome reason, but if you can reasonably fairly test
people for something that's important, without much overhead cost or without looking like
a manipulating piece of crap, then it can be useful. I probably bid a separate book on how to
prune your social garden to have more enjoyment and less pain from the friends, lovers and
family relationships that you have at your life, that's a book on its own. The important part
that I'm telling you is you're going to run into this problem.

You're going to try and solve it the wrong way, because you think you're getting things
talked for thing talking sake, when in reality you're getting crap talked to make sure that
you're reliable and durable. Understanding the intention and understanding, let's get it over



with but I'm piece of crap, I understand I suck, whatever, maybe that works or maybe they
see it's kind of sending in the got to hurt you extra. It's like calling your credit card company
and preemptively verifying your identity. If you tell them, "Hi I'm this. My birthday is this,
address is this, mother maiden name is this, can you fix my account just with their program
to do. They will ask you more questions that you didn't volunteer the answers for because
they want to see that you had to work. If you were happy to volunteer those answers and
you didn't really have to work for them. Xx these two paragraphs need more explaining, I
don't understand the concept

Back to testing. Should you test those around you? Yes. Reasonably and not in a time
consuming manner, not unreasonably. Is it reasonable for me to test the fire department by
burning my house down? No. Is it reasonable for me to test my immune system by injecting
weird diseases into my blood? No. Is it reasonable to test my blood clotting by chopping my
head off? No. The amount that you can gain by testing someone is actually in direct
proportion to the options you have upon a failed test. If you like to test all the girls that
you're with, what's the only thing that can happen from that test? They could pass or they
could fail. Or, they could get an inconclusive or detect it. You're a testing kind of a person,
and most people don't like that stuff because all risk for them. They pass, they're where
they started. They fail, their life is much worse. It's like it's an option that's one directional
for them. When you test people, they're mostly getting fucked over on the deal. You're
actually to some small degree harming everyone that you test because you're offering them
the opportunity of getting kicked out of your life with the upside of basically nothing.

You don't even want to tell them that it was a test because then they'll punish you for doing
that test. I think it's an interesting metric to know that you harm those people that you test
to some degree. In the corporate environment, when you give people tests that are time
consuming, you sucked away the time of lots of people for a test. There's a requisite to a
job, but you're only giving one person the job. That's like having an artistic project, a
competition to draw a logo for you and lots of people compete, but only one of the logos
gets chosen. Think about how many man hours of, I won't say totally wasted but lightly
wasted time occurred because they were all doing the same work, when, perhaps you could
have looked at the field of participants and seen if any of their other work is good enough
and only pick the ones that have a chance of winning?

Therefore, the concept is that testing is actually an attack on the other person. I never heard
that before. It could very interesting discovery for me. When you're out there harming your
loved ones and the people that are on your team by testing them, you better have some
upside for doing that. The upside that you have only exists if upon a failure by them you can
do something better. If you live on a deserted island with one other person and your lovers,
you test them, they fail, now you don't like them, now they're not worthy of your time. Your
option is loneliness because you're on a deserted island for my thought experiment.

If only one person in the world can do this job, for some weird reason, no reason to test
them! They do it or they don't, if you test them and they fail, you are still going to hire them
because you hope that that was just a random flip from that only guy for the job. How much
do you want the job actually to get done? Maybe you want to save your money so much
that you just don't ever hire them. Maybe in that case, the testing still matters. My point is,
testing is more valuable the more changes that you can make upon a failure. If you can't



afford to go back out there and find a new party to interact with, or you can't afford to hire
somebody that's better, or you suck so much that no one wants to be with you anyway,
maybe you're better off lowering your standards than testing and failing somebody out
when you don't have any options? Now, should you have more options? Yes. Go build them,
become worthy of them. Should you deserve an amazing relationship? Yes. Be an amazing
partner. Earn the right to demand an amazing relationship.

The discovery that I'm trying to share with you is testing can be good. It can be bad, it can be
harmful. It usually is and its value has more to do with you and the options you have based
on when that other party that's been tested fails, than it does with the party that's tested -
you're not bringing much value to their life by giving them that lose or break even
experience. If you want to hear about the definition of a bad test, some guy's ex-girlfriend
arranges with his new girlfriend to meet up with this guy on a bridge and to finally decide
which one of them he loves more by both of them jumping off the bridge and seeing which
one he says. This is a true story that happened in China. The guy chose the new girl and told
his buddy to save the other one. The buddy didn't want to jump in the water so that lady
had to get saved by the fire department or the police after he walked to the end of the
bridge and got them and found them. Can you think of a shadier or stupid or less fair way to
"test a person"? I would say that risking your own death and risking the fact that your own
death was very reasonably understood to be the fault of a responsibility of the other party
that was there. It was expected to save your life. That is a pretty harmful task to the point of
being considered an attack. I think unreasonable unfair tests for particularly greedy and
jealous self-serving motives that don't help the other party should be considered punishable
and as a tax.

lmportance(Org me better xx )

Much of what makes you human primarily developed for others to observe rather than for
you to experience. It was for them, and through their correct response and your bond to
them, then you. Laughter, yelling when surprised, crying, all signaling mechanisms built to
tell those around you the truth faster and more honestly than you could consciously
through effort. This is why dogs raise their tails and wag them, they need a fast thought free
method to communicate important information to their team. What real advantages do we
have as humans over all the other animals in the kingdom? Intelligence, communication,
tools. How good would the tools be without communication? Without someone being able
to tell you how to make one, or show you by example or with writing, you wouldn't get too
far.

A lot of people, we all want to feel important. I want to feel important, everyone wants to
feel important. Why? Because it's the social world we live in. I don't make my own food, I
didn't invent this language, I don't make my own clothes, I didn't pave these roads, I didn't
fucking invent the gas that's going in the car. I need other people to survive and if other
people don't think you're important, if you're not significant, and the shit goes down or the
resources get limited, you get fucked first and nobody wants to get fucked first. We're
programmed to matter.

Another upside: if there is wisdom of the crowds, which by theory in study there is, how do
you execute the wisdom of the crowds personally? You got to give a fuck about the crowd
and what does that mean? It means that you're not a psychopath without feeling and
empathy and caring about what other people think. It means that if you care about what



other people think, then you must want to be respected by them. You want them to think
you're important and look at the social group you're in and feel important and have
significance. Now, do some people do this wrong? Yes. Some people try and get significance
in a way which is more harmful than another way. Some people get it at the end of a gun,
some people get it through gang membership, some people get it through self-harm.

The Jackass guys became very successful and caused a lot of laughter in the world by
destroying their bodies. These guys bodies are nearly destroyed; they have catheters, they
are missing tons of teeth, they have PTSD, they have got huge health issues because they
sacrificed their bodies for probably lots of reasons, but one important one was the
significance and feelings of the people who saw them doing what they were doing. They
didn't just fuck their bodies up, they fucked their bodies up with lots of cameras and those
lots of cameras were an important part of what they did. If they were alone, you'd find they
did a lot less of that crazy self-harming stuff. For social situations that are behind the
camera, they'll do more because the profit to them is more, the payoff is more. If you're the
only one laughing, it's funny, but if you and the rest of the world is laughing, it's way
funnier!

What's the summary of this section? There are more and less profitable ways to become
significant. Some of the things you might do to become significant, like keep flapping your
lips and talking when you already know the person you're talking to understands what
you're trying to say, but you just want to seem smart so you keep talking. If communication
is as useful as getting an idea from one person to another, we'll say that's the level one form
of communication, maybe influence and motivation will be level two, level three. Let's say
level one is just getting the idea across. As soon as you know you got your idea across,
please shut up and let the next good idea get spread.

They say women are a mystery and very hard to understand. It turns out that they're only
hard to understand and a mystery if you don't understand the evolutionary psychology and
game theory behind what they do. When you start to analyze that and have it in your head
rather quickly, or the tacit understanding of it, then you understand why they do what they
do and you understand why it works and how you might not even suggest that they change
much of it. Apparently everyone wins imaginary arguments in their showers. Due to the
prevalence of the confession, I think it's obvious how important relationships and
significance are in our society. Studies show xx that the pain you feel when you don't get the
attention you desire from a person you feel is important, is nearly the same pain you feel
from physical pain.

How do you feel important? Through force. But how do you get away with it? Have a good
excuse. There’s guys that go out, dying for an excuse, and I’ve even felt that way. Sometimes
life's got you down, and you don't feel like you've got a way out. You want to hurt
somebody, because it works. You hurt somebody, and now you feel important and they will
respect. Now you have more power because you just took it. It's not beautiful, it's not
fucking beautiful. You know what's weird though, when I describe it, it makes me feel good.
That's fucked up. We all have that piece of shit in us, that wants to do the wrong thing.

When I'm not feeling good, and someone fucks up, oh my God, I'd love to social justice
warrior that guy, which is the popular thing. People get their violence out through social
justice warrior shit recently.



Social justice warriors want to do negative reinforcing, retaliatory actions under the guise of
something positive. It's just a way to feel more important, more significant and be violent
and hurtful towards someone else with a good excuse. You can be compassionate to people
who are bigots, that's not social justice warrior. It's not called social justice, it's called social
justice warrior.

I believe that crying is a signaling mechanism that you genuinely need assistance. When
someone scares you and you scream, that's for everyone else to come help your ass!
Because you need help, because some shit just showed up. Posture, eye contact, crying,
yelling, body movement, all of these things, they are signaling.

For child bearing to take so long, and for survival in general against other tribes, against the
elements, animals and disease, and just general life is so hard that we needed to develop
that strength, we needed to develop that cooperation, or we would just be lizard or tiger
food. To not be somethings food is actually a lot of work, that shit wants to kill you, eat you
and you got the littlest teeth and claws, so what do you got. You got cooperation and tools,
and let me tell you, if someone didn't teach you how to build the tool, very unlikely that you
would figure it out on your own. You don't even get to use tools without cooperation. You
think that if you were on an island you would know to make a spear? Even knowing that
spears exist and how they are made, you still might not figure it out. You might never make
a good spear, and if you can't make a good spear, what can you make? That's the most basic
thing in the god damn world.

I need to cut wood, I need a knife, god damn I have no idea, how do I make a rope? No idea,
twist some shit together, see if that works. It gets a lot trickier with emotional needs, I think
there needs to be like an emotional service industry, "more on demand" though, we have
physical services on demand, such as ordering a pizza. People schedule dates with their
therapists all day long. I've never had a therapist but I can guarantee you that anybody that
sits and listens to your god damn problems, even if they just nod, you feel that that person
is important, and connected, vital and really helping you. That's what you probably feel and
it's probably true. Human beings need to feel heard.

What could be more significance giving, than shutting up and listening to someone else?
Actually listening to them. How could you give someone more significance than that? When
you had an idea today, how much time did I put into making sure I got it? All the time it
took! Because I know it's important for you to feel that I understand you. It's very
important. It's also greedy for me, I want to understand what you are saying. Might be great
for me, you might be saying something really cool.

Misc.(Org me xx)

You hear the saying: "success leaves clues." You hear it so often and it's so obviously true
that no one ever does anything with it. People hear science works, and then you notice that
they don't do any fucking science. You hear people talk about how important it is to eat
healthy and then you look at what they eat and you're like, "Wow. It's like almost these
people discovering that a good thing exists allows them to feel like they're profiting
vicariously by other people actually doing the things while they, themselves, do fucking
nothing."



You could almost make the statement that telling people that there's a better way to do
things and showing people that are doing them better could actually do those people harm,
in that they might think that those people are part of their social group and therefore
enough of that is being done already, that they actually feel benefit from it. For instance,
there's a girl you want to make love to and you already have a girlfriend, so you want to
have your friend hook up with that girl because some part of you feels great profit in seeing
that girl get hooked up with by someone else in your crew, in your group, in your family.
That doesn't just exist in interpersonal relationships with group fitness, it also exists in shit
that you choose not to do because you subconsciously think someone else on your crew is
doing it, but in reality this isn't the type of thing where there’s a herd immunity.

There is no herd immunity for being a fat overweight fuck. The health costs of you being an
overweight fuck will arrive upon you, regardless of how many of your friends choose to be
healthy. Now, you could abstract and make some fancy shit that their gut biomes are
different, they might share saliva with you, they might be more resistant to disease and
have better immune systems and somehow that would benefit you, but let's be fucking
serious, you would get those same benefits more or less if you weren't a fat fuck yourself.

Anyway, the discovery on this part of speech is that sometimes people feel as though
they're getting progress by watching other people's progress, like watching sports. Your
team is winning, you feel like a winner, but let’s be serious, your team is not actually your
team. It's a group of people that wouldn't give you them time of day if they saw you. You
think and you brainwash yourself into thinking your team, your tribe and your club and you
are kicking ass because your team is kicking ass, but in reality you're not kicking ass, they
are.

In reality, in a time of war, they're not kicking ass either, they're playing a game when
there's real shit at stake. The playing of games and the optimizing of outcomes for people
who aren't you, but you have somehow decided are a part of you; the teams you choose,
the friends you choose, the family that you probably didn't get to choose, but continue to
allow to be a part of your life, don't mistake their progress and their excellence for your
own. Don't starve yourself from excellence and progress because you've already fulfilled
that desire and become full on the food of other people's progress.

Tony Robbins says, all pain comes from one of your six needs not being met, but I have
some problems with that stuff. Tony Robbins' 6 human needs are a useful way to look at the
very complex inputs and outputs of the human emotional system. However, at the same
time, they are inaccurate and wishful, and even though they are inaccurate and wishful,
they are still way more useful than anything else I have found. Tony Robbins' human needs
are certainty, significance, variety, connection, growth and contribution. Growth and
contribution do not exist as needs for lots of people, there are people that are happy with
the way shit is. They don't need anything else, they're happy.

Dawkins: Nice guys finish first

The winner was tit for tat, a program based on "equal retaliation", and Dawkins illustrates

the four conditions of tit for tat.
a. Unless provoked, the agent will always cooperate.



b. If provoked, the agent will retaliate.

c. The agent is quick to forgive.

d. The agent must have a good chance of competing against the opponent more than once.

In a second trial, this time of over sixty applicants, tit for tat won again.

How to apologize properly

People want to be apologized to because it reduces the chance that they'll be apologized to
again. If someone harms you or wrongs you, what is most important to you is that they
don't do it again. Apologies are a way to gain confidence as to the brightness and excellence
of your future by having a life free from unnecessary or unfair harm, because the person
that has harmed you understands the following things: they understand exactly what harm
was done, why that harm was unfair, how the harm occurred, why the harm shouldn't
occur, they tell you how they're not going to harm you in the future, and they tell you why
it's important to themselves that they not harm you in the future, and how they're going to
specifically not harm you in the future. The combination of original understanding of what
occurred, intention as to why what occurred was bad, intention and understanding as to
how what occurred happened, then leads you into correct future action for correct future
good reason.

The issuance of all of those things must be with sincerity, because sincerity is required to
have a confidence that that plan gets executed. Just because someone knows that they did
you wrong, don't want to do you wrong and just because they know why they shouldn't and
they don't want to again, they may do it again anyway because there's so much profit in it,
or it's their habit, or it's their nature. Even someone that apologizes, their apology can be
worthless.

The point is to give you, as a reasonable person, a better feeling about being apologized to
so that you can operate cooperatively with them again, or realize that they're bullshitters
and that you need to move on with your life and not give them the chance to fuck you over
again, because you don't believe in the likelihood that they'll follow through and not harm
you again. That's the reason that sincerity is so important, not only because internally it
anchors their own belief system to understand the importance of doing this thing right,
because it's emotionally tied to a feeling, which is usually followed through with extra
attention, extra detail, extra effort, for things that people truly feel remorse, sorrow or
importance about. They assign more processing power in their brain towards them. They
assign more recognition of things that lead to those events in the real world, they notice
that something's happening quicker.

If you love your car and your car makes a little bit of a funny sound, you notice it. For people
who don't love their car, it can make all types of funny sounds and they just don't notice or
care, because they didn't develop that caring by trying to develop it or by accident. The
people who care are more mindful, and therefore more sensitive and interact in a more
positive manner with that specific thing of which they care about. How many times in your
life has someone fucked you over, and then when you said it wasn't cool, they started telling
you all of the reasons why they did it?




Guess what, every single excuse they give you for why they did what they did leads them
farther from correct action. Every minute they spend telling you about how they fucked you,
how they didn't mean to, how it wasn't their fault but was some other thing, every single
word that they say down those paths leads them farther from correct action in the future,
leads them farther from having cooperation with you, leaves you with a higher degree of
certainty that they will fuck you over again, and the next time they fuck you, they're going to
have a really cool excuse and story why it wasn't their responsibility, there was nothing that
could be done about it, they're powerless to do anything about it. They sell themselves this
line of bullshit making themselves less powerful, less reliable, less trustworthy, less
benefitting from a cooperative relationship with you or anyone else that detects their
nature or habit. It fucks them over, it fucks you over, and it makes the world a worse place.

There's two components to making the world a better place using this system. If you screw
up, you will give a good apology. A good apology has the minimum dumbass excuses
possible. Dumb excuses don't lead to a brighter future, dumb excuses don't tell someone
that you are actually a good person that cares about them and wants the best things for
them and is also committed to doing it. "In the future, I am going to do this thing because I
am committed to this outcome." - That's a good apology. "Sir, I'm sorry I was late. I
understand how important it is that I show up here on time, I really appreciate the
opportunity to work here. Here are the things that I'm going to do to make sure that I'm
never late again. I'm going to verify that my car starts within an hour of when I need to I
eave for work, and if for some reason it doesn't start, now I've got an extra hour to get it
fixed so that I can still show up and work on time. I'm going to fill up my car at night, so that
even if my kids take it out for a joy ride, or the gas station isn't working or open, or if some
other weird thing happens, there's more gas in my tank that enhances the chance that I can
get to work. I'm going to have it so that if for some reason there's a blizzard and I can't get
to work no matter what, I'm able to work from home because I've got the phone numbers
that I need, I've got the data I need." I'm taking proactive, measured action in order to
achieve this goal which is important to me and important to you. That is an amazing
apology. That is an apology that does more than lip service. That is an apology that leads to
a better world for you and the person that you're apologizing to.

Now, how many things in that apology were excuses? "Well, you know, my car usually
starts, and I didn't know that it would be snowing, and I didn't know that the gas station
would be closed. I just didn't foresee these things." This is because you didn't care. If you
cared, it would be a hobby for you to think about and you would do it.

As an example, the difference between someone that takes responsibility and one that
doesn't. Through taking that responsibility, that person becomes more powerful, more
effective, more worthy of higher pay, more worthy of higher and greater employment with
the best companies that exist. The person that takes responsibility becomes powerful. If you
think you're not responsible, you have made yourself powerless. If it is true that you are not
responsible for being late, then it is true that there is nothing you can do to fix it. You can't
get a more reliable car, you can't live closer to work, you can't live at work, you can't bring
your work home with you, you can't leave earlier, you can't start your own company and
work as a partner with your original company instead of an employee, you can do none of
those things because you're not responsible.

Police & the masses



Some people don't want to be here at all, they can't wait to get off this trip. They kill
themselves. Everyone in this world has a completely different set of responses that are kind
of hard to predict. It's like when a policeman pulls you over in the United States, and he's
got his hand on his gun, it's kind of scary. I know why you've got your hand on your gun,
because you're reducing the amount of time it's going to take to kill me. I don't really like
that. Some people, they don't like how the policeman's hiding in your blind spot, you can't
see what he's doing, he's sneaking up on you, he's blinding you with his lights, he's calling
for backup, he's having you sit on your hands, he's doing all of these things which you feel
are totally unfair to you, that make you feel threatened.

You're not armed, you're just going about your life, maybe got pulled over for a speeding
ticket or you didn't come to a complete stop at a stop sign, and now your existence as a
human being is being physically threatened because you're in the lottery that he sees you
doing something differently than you do. You forget that you're in a dangerous situation,
you reach for your cell phone, he just watched a YouTube video where a policeman got shot,
it's on his mind. He thinks your phone's a gun, and now you're getting shot. Is that fair?

Here's the interesting part of this story, look at it from his perspective. What is the
difference between a good guy and a bad guy, visually? How can you tell the difference,
visually? Can you tell the difference between a good guy and a bad guy? Can you identify a
serial killer who's got a warrant out for his arrest, that knows when he gets that license and
runs it, that he's going to go do life in jail and be executed, and he'll do anything to not have
that happen, including kill the policeman that's going to run that license? The policeman is
quite reasonable in keeping his hand on his gun, in keeping in the blind spot, in calling for
backup and blinding you with the lights because the less threatened he feels, the more
secure the things he does are, the less likely he is to accidentally shoot you, because he felt
threatened because of something you did.

What would be normally intuitive to a human being is that you want to maximize your
humanity and you want to feel less threatened. You'll feel less threatened if he does less
what you would consider crazy bullshit, like unclipping the clasp on his firearm or keeping
his hand on his gun. In reality, the actual thing that works is when he treats you like a total
and complete criminal, has you sit on your hands, and does all the things that he can do to
dehumanize you, because through that dehumanization, you become more secure, because
he is less likely to accidentally shoot you from feeling threatened.

Now this is one of those situations in a world where everyone's playing a slightly different
video game. Ask any law enforcement officer what the most dangerous call they go out on
is, and you’ll find that domestic calls, where the passions are at their highest, are the most
likely to end in violence, xx Many man has been driven to murder over the status of his
relationship to another man.

They're not going to call you on your birthday. They're not going to send you gifts. They're
not going to bail you out of jail if you get arrested. They're not your friends. If they've been
on the job long enough, and met enough truly evil people, they discover that truly evil and
despicable people look just like you and me. They tend to not treat you so nicely and see
you as something to be ticketed and incarcerated, rather than celebrated - at least in South
Florida.



You will find the logic of keeping your distance from people, activities, behaviors that offer
more risk of harm than benefit is a universally great strategy.

Do watch the YouTube talk "Never speak to the police". It's eye opening for sure.

Colleagues

There are a lot of people in this world that have employees, and some of them haven't
learned to lead through example. They're paying a great privilege to have employees and
instead of becoming better men themselves and getting more performance out of their
employees, they're a shittier man themselves. Not only do they get less from their own
weak performance because they don't feel obligated to perform, lead and be honorable and
respected through positive behavior and output, and so they lose twice.

They lose once by sucking themselves and they lose the next time by their employees
noticing they suck and doing less for them. The winner that leads by example, is honorable
and brings his A game, he's gets all the benefits from himself, which may exceed what his
employees can generate for him, which I guess depends on how many employees he has
and whether he's using them right. Two, his employees, they're driven to excellence. I don't
think you can find too many examples of successful teams or successful companies whose
leaders are giant douche bags who have nothing good going for them. Maybe they exist, but
they're probably the exception rather than the rule.

Arguing

Why argue?

You will probably find very, very little enjoyment in educating the people you meet on a day
to day basis. They will hate being lectured by you, and to add injury to insult, they won't
even learn, and if they do learn, they won't do. Save your breath and stop having one-to-one
conversations to the maximum of your ability. If you spread your word through scalable
means, such as video and audio, and allow them to be transmitted to people electronically
and in print. Then you can positively influence lives at scale and when people post
uneducated and hateful comments, you quite literally don't have to read them. When you
have a one-to-one conversation in the street, say with someone promoting Islam and
handing out mini-Korans, you're going to find that you can't avoid the negative feedback. It
will take your time, and it will not pay you back.

If you're building an idea and if you are the edge of understanding an idea and the forefront,
that pedantic shit is actually super important, because that's the difference between getting
next idea right or not. For the layman, who's not on the edge of understanding, who's not
getting ten different opinions about a thing that compare and contrast them in his own
mental research paper, the eighty percent is quite good, and you should focus on those
eighty percent. Do not get trapped up on the two percent, unless it's your thing, if you have
a focus on a hobby or a thing, fuck around with two percent. You know what, you can still
fuck around at that two percent arguing with the guy that just told it to you, you don't have
to educate him. He knows, so get what you can get from that guy, absorb. You'll find that
the amount of profit that comes from attempting to change other people is that most
people hate you, and they don't want to hear your bullshit. Are you really helping them by
making them hate you and giving them advise they won't take? I don't think you are, you
may be making them feel worse.



I have a chapter on how the highest and best use of someone that has just met you is to
argue with everything you say, so that they can appear cool to onlookers, or maybe even
you. This is variable, based on two things. One, their estimate of whether they want to align
with you or not, whether they see value in, whether they see more value in being
competitive to you and fighting with you. Or, whether they see more value in aligning with
you. You'll find that when you present the same idea in the same way to two identical
people in two alternate universes, what a lucky example that would be, that the person, the
twin, that sees more value in you because he feels that you have something to offer him,
and will be around long enough to provide it, will tend to be much more receptive to your
ideas, whereas a person who knows that you're leaving shortly, or knows that you are
unable to provide them any value, monetary, social, whatever, is going to see more profit in
being more belligerent and disagreeing with your idea before the facts.

When you meet people and you want to influence them, thus have less arguments and
more progress and education, to see if you can display that you have value to offer and then
imply that you'll be around long enough to offer it. Now, will this work with everyone?

Nope. Will this even work most of the time? Depends on which kind of shit you're selling. If
what you're selling is wrong, I hope it fails all the time - stop trying to spread wrong ideas.

Don't aim for overrespect by trying to take credit for every single thing that you could or
should, because at some point you're going to lose more than you gain. If people don't
already respect you to the degree that you think they should, it's not because you haven't
given them enough evidence or won enough arguments, it's because they have profit in or a
habit of not doing so. Once you've reached the minimum effective dose of respect
transition, pass that credit out and you'll see more profit.

If you think it's your job to make the whole world believe properly about a thing, you need
to pre-suppose that the same stupidity that brought them to a solution different than the
one that you feel you've got right, is the same stupidity that they'll employ to misinterpret,
ignore what it is that you're trying to teach them. It's the reason that there's an education
system that revolves around you not getting to learn a new thing until you learn the last
thing. If you didn't learn the last thing, you don't get to learn the next thing, they keep you
in that class again and again, and then, and only then, when they think you'll benefit from a
harder class that builds on the last class do you earn the opportunity to learn that new
thing.

If you go to a group of stupid people, there are things that they're incapable of learning.
Even if they were capable of learning, there's prerequisites that they need to understand in
order to employ that, and to hope that they've met the prerequisites, and today is the day
that they're ready to receive the information, you present it in a way that they've never
seen before, that they haven't already discounted, haven't already misconstrued, haven't
already become immune to, for all of those things to align, for you to be the day, the minute
and the moment and the bearer of truth and change for that person, it's very unlikely. I
think that it's the reason that so few Republicans go into arguments with Democrats and
leave having changed parties. If you were to chart all of the political conversations that have
ever occurred, and chart how many of those conversations resulted in a genuine belief
change, you'd find it to be shockingly low. This is why, for some reason, people who vote
Republican tend to stay that way for the rest of their lives, and people who vote Democrat



tend to stay that way for the rest of their lives, because whatever immunity to new facts
and ways of believing things they had when they came in, they keep for a lifetime.

My point is, don't live your life as a cock blocker of ideas and don't live your life as a
problem solver of other people's problems, because you will be restricted by what problems
they think matter and what they're aware of, particularly people that are overly conceited
or arrogant and full of themselves that just happen to be wrong as well. That's the worst of
all worlds. If you've got a bad personality and you're still productive, effective and useful,
we're willing to pay the personality price. However, if you've got a bad personality and
you're spreading the wrong ideas in the wrong way and causing the world to be a worse
place, that's not a good place to be. If you look at a lot of political arguments and the way
they're structured, with the ad hominem attacks and the assumption of worse motive and
intention, there's somebody on one side of the argument doing real bad for the planet. You
can argue the right things the wrong way. You can try to achieve the right goals with the
wrong methods, do more harm than good.

When you disregard specificity, you end up in arguments with people you actually agree
with. There’s a law which I’ve quoted earlier xx, you can look it up again, where by which
two logical people, given the same data will always arrive at the same conclusions. The only
way it doesn't occur is if one of them is not logical, that's it. What I think happens in this
world of intelligent smart people, some choose a different set of facts than others, some
have hidden objectives that they're trying to achieve, that they're not aware of, and some of
them just don't speak with enough specificity to exclude the arguments which are close to
theirs, but not theirs. Then, they have to defend positions that are not theirs. If people are
more careful with words, more mindful of their objectives, then some of the smartest
people of the world could come to more consensus of the correct paths. At least if not
coming to consensus on a path, coming to consensus on "yes, a person that believes these
things should choose for this, and we will both amend and update our decisions if we can
discover better prices, better evidence, better input for us to manipulate for better output."

A good saying is "outstanding claims desire outstanding evidence". Thus, if you think that
you know something rare and insane has happened, you should require rather rare and
insane proof of it happening, because you care about Bayes theorem and you accurately
know that you must look at the likelihood that something is actually happening or not, and
therefore modify what you require as evidence. Therefore, your evidence required for a rare
thing must be much larger and much harder to pass than the evidence required for things
that are common.

A funny way of phrasing this is the way Christopher Hitchens did when he said "that with
can be -I don't rem if he said proposed or claimed- can be thrown aside without evidence."
xx check what he actually said. The words were magical and better. He was a cunning
linguist, that which can be presented without evidence can be disregarded without
evidence.

Stop educating fools, there's no profit in it. If you win, you lose, they hate you. If you lose,
you lose, you lost an argument to an idiot. Sleight of mouth, Dunning Kruger strikes again,
assuming someone else’s best argument.

Xx Confusing, clarify?



Be smart enough to lose an argument and learn something. I could never figure out why
people didn't respect intellect more. It is as though when arguing about an idea, people care
so much about thinking they've won the argument, that they can't learn. They care more
about looking right than learning a new thing. That is why so often you will see truly well-
spoken and knowledgeable people being talked down to and yelled at by idiots, because the
idiots are so short-sighted as to see the only goal as appearing to win an argument, not
making a powerful intelligent friend, or really trying to change their mind, or even learning
themselves. They're only interested in the shortest goal they can visualize, which is to
appear to win this argument right now, in front of these people.

If only the stupid were smarter, they'd know enough that there's often an opportunity to
learn from a skilled opponent instead of saying the same things over and over again every
time a subject comes up. If you have a good memory, you will more quickly tire of saying the
same things over and over again, because they are fresher in the mind of someone who
remembers how short a time ago you had to say the same things. Being reasonable and
better at winning arguments by assuming someone else's best argument and improving its
presentation is possible.

Chess of winning an argument

Absurd statements to find common ground

You want to kill all cops? Ok, how about just pause?

Feelings

Honor the feelings, not the words. What would make you feel I understand you?

Debates

Hitchens debate tactics

Ingratiates himself to his audience

Isn't it wonderful to have such people volunteering to hear about X on such a
wonderful night? That is to say, I won't speak to a captive audience, so anyone
that's not here voluntarily, please leave now. I like the people of X because of Y
good thing.

Live aging debate ideas

Dress up like really, really old dude, then tear that shit off. Pretend you're introducing
yourself as the upcoming speaker, then rip on out of it.

Imagine the silliness of me selling you a cure for your disease called the magic high
five. HIGH FIVE! You're cured! Borat tonality, stupid, don't fall for it.

Keep your questions much more question than statement

Literally wear a fake firearm setup to point that at the back of your head.

"Hello everyone, I have a surprise for you, I'm actually pro aging. I want everyone to
start to smell funny, hairs to grow out of the ears." Reframe the question of the
debate; "It's obvious that X and X, and so really the question of the debate is Y, which
is unfortunate for my opponents here, because if those three things are true, they
must lose this debate."



It's odd to be put arguing on stage against someone who is literally on death's side,
arguing for death to kill more people sooner. I wish death himself would take my
opponent's spot so I could battle the foe directly. If you're already old, you're fucked,
we can't help you. The older you get, the less we can do for you. Every cure to every
disease is anti-aging medicine. That's what aging is, you see, it's just all the set of crap
we haven't cured yet that takes longer to fuck you up compared to problems that act
faster, like heart attacks.

What's the real difference between a heart attack that takes five minutes to kill you,
and a gradual heart attack that takes a few years, or a life time? In the end your heart
has killed you, one way or the other. If I choose to shoot you with a rifle, but the
trigger has a really long trigger pull, say it takes a year for me to pull it and get it to
fire, do you as the bullet receiver care how long it took me to fuck you up?

In this argument, if judged fairly, one extra day of life would win the premise. If you
think people should live one day longer, to say goodbye to their loved ones, then yes,
the motion is that life isn't long enough. A single minute won would win the debate
logically, so stupid. What a stupid question, whose life? The life of someone on death
row, perhaps not. The life of someone just born, yeah, let's give them a chance.

Whatever cures you implement will never benefit everyone equally. Aging research
doesn't help young people getting hit by busses or killed in war. What a poorly framed
question and analysis. Immortality is impossible, even our sun will die, so can we stop
talking about crap that's already proven, and not relevant? Gravity also exists, what
has that to do with healing people?

Look everyone, I brought a bottle of pills with me, what would you do if I told you that
these would lock the age of your body right now, at this moment in time? It comes
with a partner pill that does the opposite, it returns you to whichever age you would
have been if you didn't take the first pill. What would you pay for such a pill? 10
dollars? 1 million dollars? All your worldly possessions you have right now, because
you'll have more than enough time to make it over and more?

That's what funding medicine and research does, it's creating that pill. The other pill
we already have, it's the pill you were born with, it's in you. If for some reason you
find the pill you were born with isn't working, and you're just too damn healthy for
your liking at your age, there's shelves of poison for sale, have a drink, have a smoke,
jump out a window. If you're afraid that someone somewhere might enjoy a few more
days on this planet, or another, and it pisses you off, cancel out their extra years by
taking some of your own. Or, you could join them in having the courage of not trying
to die earlier by stifling medicine.

Being wrong

The point isn't to never be wrong; to push heavy weight up a great hill, one's feet must slip
time to time. If you're never wrong, you're rarely right. Respecting your audience by
assuming they understand your analogy is team building. If you believe in constant and
never ending improvement and your curriculum hasn't changed in 20 years, you're a
hypocrite.



Check who the happiest people are. Islanders, nonagricultural, monotonous vs intermittent
reward? Possible test; land locked culture with island like society, but non-island like
geography. Rocky mountainous or nomadic cultures? The advice from a homeless person
that they couldn't take themselves, the advice they could never take? Remember that smart
guy that quoted Maslow's hierarchy of needs as his inspiration? Nope.

Posture / Appearance / Group Signaling
Luck

Because luck happens, you can't just rank people's achievements, and then assume that
those people are intelligent, effective or worthy in the same order that they have achieved,
for if that were the case, then luck would play no role at all. You could just look at a person's
work ethic or knowledge, and then automatically know where they're ranked in the world of
financial achievement.

Jealousy is a signaling mechanism

Jealousy is like the signaling that bacteria or fungus used when they found food. That's what
jealousy is, jealousy is like "come over here and do what I'm doing, because it works really
well." It's like an effective group signaling strategy.

The reason jealousy is such an effective emotion, it's the reason you feel jealousy. You could
also interpret jealousy the other way like Nancy Kerrigan, and try and cripple that
motherfucker, not the right way. Jealousy can lead you to a positive outcome or a negative
outcome, depending on what you do with the input. It is more often than not a useful input,
or I believe we would have seen it go away.

What jealousy is; I see that other person has something that I want, and you want it because
you think you can have it or deserve it. It hurts that they have it and you don't, because you
have a belief in yourself that you could have that thing. When you see someone doing
something that you could never possibly do, you're not jealous. If I see superman flying in a
film, I’m not like "that superman, I don't like him, I should be able to fly." It just doesn't feel
right. By the way, I believe in jealousy, I think it's effective, and that there is a reason that its
around. It is a signaling mechanism that says "I'm over here, this is working, pay attention,
its working, keep an eye on me because it works." How else would you signal that to
people?

Posture / Appearance

You should choose what face to wear during your life, for it not only greatly affects those
that look at you, it affects the inside you, looking at you.

Why the whites of your eyes are so white, it's actually group signaling.

You can measure the advantage of looking like what you are instead of looking like what
you're not in relationship to the likelihood you'll be befriended instead of attacked and
whether you are on the offense or the defense. Xx Clarify, the idea is a little vague?

Re-Framing

Revenge seeking

There's a wisdom that you should forgive your enemies. I can tell you why that appears to
be a wisdom. You're built for a society where you have constant, rather reoccurring
interaction with everyone, because that's how it used to be. Food was scarce, shelter was
scarce, danger was omnipresent, and thus you had to spend a lot of time around other
people that you could cooperate with - kin, family, friends, even enemies. If you are



constantly executing the tit-for-tat game strategy, where you punish those who you feel
have done you wrong to enhance the chance that they do right to align your goals by
artificially introducing a tit-for-tat strategy, which would normally exist. You cut a tree down
with an axe, the tree doesn't like trying to get back at you unless you're stupid enough to let
gravity do its work for you and let the tree fall on you.

The point is, in these societies that we're in today, where we can choose who we spend our
time with, if you execute a tit-for-tat strategy where you try and punish those who have
wronged you, you will be enduring that state of attempting to get back at them and wrong
them in return, when they're not around to sense that you're doing that. You're much
longer destroying your own positive outlook and increasing your cortisol levels, harming
your longevity and making it so other people don't want to cooperate with you, because
you're a mopey fuck. How does that happen, how do you get to mopey Fucksville? You get
to mopey Fucksville by executing a game theory for the benefit of interacting with people
that aren't there.

If you do road rage and beat up the guy that cut you off, you never see that guy again and
you don't reap the benefits of making him operate in a superior ethical fashion. For the
same reason that if you execute a revenge strategy on those that aren't around there to see
it by not forgiving and purposely being vengeful and unhappy towards a person, you're the
one that pays a price and you never get the benefit from it. The tit-for-tat game theory only
works on the other person. It's like kidnapping somebody; if you kidnap somebody and you
can't deliver the ransom demand, you aren't going to get a ransom. You have to be able to
communicate with the person, you have to be able to have a two-way communication
channel. Or, at least a one-way communication channel to say you act like this, I act like this,
our goals are aligned. You act like that, I fuck you up, our goals are aligned.

If you can't transmit the goal alignment, then you can't get any rewards. If you forgive those
who have wronged you, get the benefit of what you're supposed to get. In a small society
when you execute a tit-for-tat strategy and you harm those that have harmed you, then
they treat you right, then you treat them right, then everyone's happy. That's the state that
you're supposed to get to, but because of isolation, problems and communication and the
fact that we don't have to be forced to be around somebody, you never get that fulfillment,
you never get that closure of having things work out. Therefore you just live in a state of
pissed off and vengeful for the benefit of working with people who aren't there. Forgive
your enemies privately and then publicly say you never forgive, and so you'll get the benefits
of being a truly poisonous animal without the cost of having to build poison.

Revenge

You'll love this one. The reason they say revenge, rather the best revenge, is a life well-lived,
is because the people that notice that you're living a good life, it triggers their desire to
execute quid pro quo, tit-for-tat, one-for-one, eye for an eye game theory strategy on you. If
you live a life well lived, they get jealous, they get angry, they start executing the program
where they feel like they have to punish you but you're not around to detect it. Therefore,
they just live in a horrible state.

Much more powerful idea than the common understanding of it is that you only get the
benefit of living the good life yourself - it's not true. You get the benefit of living the good
life yourself and you get the benefit of those fuckers torturing themselves trying to get you



to not feel good and not have a good life anymore, but they're not effective at it. They just
destroy themselves.

But's to and's

If you want to influence those around you, switch your but's to and's. Don't ever use the
word "but", just switch it with the word "and". Test it, try it, you'll see what I mean. Allow
them to save face. Like a tactic Christopher Hitchens would use, is that he wouldn't say
things to you clearly. He would make you guess at them a bit as though it were an inside
joke that you're in the know about, because you are on the inside because you already
agreed with him. "My brothers and sisters, you know what I'm talking about when I say..."
and whatever you frame in that way is going to be wildly more accepted. This is because
he's already aligned with you, he has already complimented you and he has already
presupposed that you believe as he does. That's a great way to start, and he was, depending
on what circle you ran in, considered to be somebody you didn't want to debate against
because you were going to get your shit stomped.

Reason for the stories

The reason I tell you these interesting warrior-type stories is that, in this world, if you want
to influence someone and you want to make an impact, saying something a single time and
hoping that they heard it, hoping that they understood it and hoping that it triggers the
response that it should, if their brain's working right and if their mind space is right, it's not
the right way to do things. Every time you read a book, you never read the same book twice.
You're going to see things differently, you're going to understand things differently. You're
going to start to see motive, oh, that's why they put this here and there. Oh, that's why they
put it in the order they did. Oh, I bet that's why they didn't mention that. You wouldn't get
most of that on the first read. After you've read a bunch of other books, you come back and
you're like, oh here's all that stuff that I didn't even understand.

Saying thank you

Saying "thank you" and not saying "please" is a better, more effective, more efficient way to
interact with people. If your friends, people you interact with and people that you might be
asking to, or telling, to do things are so concerned that they might get fucked out of
gratitude upon completing their task that they need to preemptively, contractually look at
you funny and make sure that you say please beforehand - they're petty and you don't have
real trust and you don't care about timing or effectiveness.

Conditional Statements & Scope limiting

If you study human compliance, the studies have shown that if you ask to cut someone in
line and then you say "because...", you get something like a 30 or 50 % higher compliance
with your request, just because you used "because". That could be a part of the reason why
I always like to use conditional statements when I speak. If you think this, then this is
obviously true, so what is the trick I used there? First I get a little bit of yes-momentum
which is if you think this, they're going to comply with that. I pre-selected the IF thing that I
was saying to match something that they already believed, which gives me one "yes" thing.

There's profit in restricting the scope of what you're asking for in increases in lifespan and
health span, because regardless, it’s not one of those things that whatever progress you
make towards one year, also at least equally goes towards 100 years. It's not easy to buy
one year and not get a shit load of extra years for free along with it. If you reduce the size of
the ask by asking for less years, whatever behaviors that would go into getting you that one
year, but as a side result get you all these extra free bonus years that you didn't have any
benefit for asking for upfront, because it would just reduce the people's likelihood to want



to give them to you. For some reason human beings feel that extra years of life are some
limited resource, that if we get them somehow, we're fucking over something or someone
else, as though it's a zero sum game. If one guy gets to live one extra year happily, that's not
good because he shouldn't get that, because "crabs in a bucket".

The other thing that I'm doing is restricting the scope of the argument. If I leave what I say
to be vague, don't include a conditional IF and they have the mission of arguing you, so
many people do, then leaving the if out allows the strong man you and expands your
argument and what you said to something that's easy for them to argue against which is a
reason you would never say something like that in the first place. I may not be something
you even believe and so if you use conditional statements which are if this would you agree
with then obviously that. Xx Needs revising after the first sentence, unclear

I notice I keep saying "obviously", we’re presupposing that is obvious. We’re using a report
that we built by agreeing on the "if" and we're inserting an "obvious" where it may not even
fit, because we feel like we can get away with it. We're speaking as though we come from
the same belief frame, so "if you believe this, then it's obvious that you believe that." That
"obvious" is totally put there for rhetorical tactic. In this instance we haven't specified what
we're talking about whatsoever. In summary, I like conditional statements, "I like, IF then", I
like it when the IF is chosen to be something that they already agree with for if you're trying
to influence people from what doesn't move them, you have no hope.

You might as well speak a language, be something they don't understand, if you want to
influence people and you want them to agree with you, then you need to speak a language
they understand. Your IF better be something that they already believe, if you can't find a
common belief to start from and can't find an If that they already agree with, you might as
well shut up and move on, because you will not be making any progress based on your
speaking until you do find common ground.

It's also a free pass if you make a statement outright and they don't agree with you, you're
rather fucked. You only get a couple of those until they want to terminate communication
and with every single disagreement you get, you get further and further from getting
agreement in the future. However, if you use conditionals, then you get treated as though
you didn't really make that agreement, because you don't have to issue the second part of
the conditional until you got agreement on the first part right.

The easiest thing in the world is to get an agreement on your if you can't get an agreement
on your IF the very concept that something might exist. Then your surely will not get
agreement that you're going to mutate and perform operations on the IF to result to an
"and then" and somehow agree with "and then" but not the if. I you can't get an If
agreement shut the fuck up and keep trying until you can. Xx Needs revising, unclear


When I discover a way that I did a thing right that I never knew that I was doing right, or
what it was or what I was doing? I just said to Tony, "You know, if you're ever going to
measure...I said, "Okay, what was the difference between this measurement and that
measurement?" And he says, "I don't really know." And I said, "Well, do you know why you
don't really know?" And I wanted to insult him, basically, but I did it in a questioning format
so it was much more acceptable. I wanted to say, "Measure it, you idiot. Why not? It's easy













to do, you can do it." But I said, "Do you know why you don't know?" And then I said, "It's
Decause you're bad at measuring, right?" So, no fightback. He's like, "Oh, yeah, I could be."
'Well, yeah, you could be good at measuring, right?" I gave him the belief that he could be
good at it if he wanted to. Instead of calling him lazy, I called him powerful.


I said the same thing, but in a language that was non-combative. But that's not even the
part, I didn't even notice I did that right in the first spot. That's just some new shit I noticed.
The shit that I wanted to brag about that I said was right was, "You know, of all the things
you' re going to measure this year, think about it, that's probably the most important thing."

I invented a set that no one has ever referenced, that no one has ever existed, of all the
things I measure this year, so that I could choose from that set, making it look more
important than it otherwise would, this measurement. I found, by accident, a way to greatly
enhance the importance of the thing by restricting it to a made-up set that didn't exist, that
no one's ever used before, but that I could accuse it of being a member of, and now,
because it is rare, you feel it's more important.

R190

If I would have chosen the set of just-if I would have just included it in the set of all the
things you do this year you would have not cared again because it would have seemed
unimportant with the million other things you do. But when I isolated it to its own category
it artificially inflated its importance, so the derivative, the reverse engineering of that
motivational technique that I just discovered, and, maybe it exists but I feel that I just
discovered it because I can't think of what the fuck it's called otherwise. Is to artificially
inflate the importance of what you're talking about by speaking to it as a member of an
artificially small set. Anytime you're trying to amplify the importance of a thing, restrict it to
an artificially small set, which makes it seem more unique and more important, that's
awesome. Xx These three paragraphs - revise! Don't understand
R191

My post-facto analysis of it is, you can artificially create a product segment, so that the thing
you're mentioning can be the halo product of that segment. Even though it may look like
shit on its own, of this category of things, it is the best thing. You're artificially giving a
'bestness' through segmentation that will be lost in having too many products otherwise.
You're better off naturally mirroring people's ability to chunk things into categories. It's
better to have something that's the best of the middle category, than to have something
that's the middle of the only category.

To set the situation up properly, you shouldn't have to figure out if other people are lying to
you or not, because they have a reason to not like you. Basically when you're trying to find
the truth, you want to set the game up so that they would win by lying, that you would
know what a lie would look like, and that you set the situation up where you get them to do
that thing that would profit them. In reality, it doesn't profit them, because you were hiding
that fact from them that once they did the thing that they thought would work for them but
what you knew was a lie, then they failed the test.

Framing and controlling perception

Lying about why you go to the gym. Isn't it funny that the only reason anyone ever works
out is for themselves, and not for any reason that someone might give them shit for.


















Therapist, where you go and talk about what sucks all the time to try to forget about what
sucks, interesting. Maybe if you talked about what was good and what you wanted, that
would be where your consciousness went. If you schedule a time to talk about everything
you don't want, you're going to find that you notice a lot of shit you don't want. Maybe shit
you wouldn't be noticing and would have forgotten about long time ago, if you changed the
meanings, and were so busy doing awesome shit that you didn't have time to think about
the suck. The suck exists for everybody, if you empower it, if you look upon it, you feel the
suck, whether it's there or not. If you go up to your friend and you go, "Why do you look sad
today?", you just fucked your friend over. He doesn't know whether he looks sad or not. You
might have just made him look sad. If you go, "Why are you so angry? Why are you so angry
right now?" You're crushing, you're forcing that to happen. They will become angry because
you falsely accused them of being angry, and are unwilling to listen to any arguments that
they have measured you improperly. There's some threads of negative focus which are self¬
reinforcing, self-fulfilling and self-creating. Then there's other threads that are positively
framed that have much higher percentage chance of causing positive outcomes.

Some interesting ways of thinking of, adding to the categorization of human behavior, and
being an experience is that there's what you are and then there's what you do. Then there's
what you can do and what you should do. I think I came up with another way to help people
visualize that we need more doctors, not less. You can start off with a false idea like "Let's
take all the people that are working in hospitals right now and have them do something
better like build mansions for billionaires. That's a good idea." That's the same thing as
letting billionaires build giant houses and make sure that none of the people doing that is
going to medicine, assuming that they have the capacity, and if they don't have the capacity
to go to medicine, the surest fact out of capacity is building a hospital instead of mansions. If
you wouldn't support going to one direction, then you notice that the inverse of that is true
as well.

A good mental exercise to get people to access the parts of them that want to live is have
them figure out what they would say to someone that was going to commit suicide, and
then have them mentally reverse it and you know, "What would you say to yourself?"

Inventing words is cool. It's one of those things where it's hard to get traction at first and
once you do get the traction, you get explosive results. It's like a diet. If your new diet
doesn't become popular, you don't have much impact, but if your diet does become
popular, holy shit, you're going to change the eating habits of a huge portion of the planet
for the period of time where that little fad diet was fad full. That's a funny word, fad full.

Thus, if you coin new terms and have the balls and the influence to get them to stick, you
bring into the global consciousness an easier path to execution for that thing. For instance,
there was a time where the term branding didn't exist and then people figured out that it
was something that worked, it was good to do. They assigned it a word and holy shit, the
branding thing is all over the place.

You're going to find that with all kinds of human behavior. Like, feeling the burn. What's
feeling the burn? Oh, that's when you work out real hard and your muscles feel like they're
hot. Oh, feeling the burn. That sounds good, I like that. Now, people are much more likely to
work out until they feel a burn. By coining terms and pushing them to stickiness, if they can



be made to be sticky, it helps to have them sound nice, feel nice, be imaginative, have those
little hooks that make moronic techniques work. Then you can for the rest of human
endeavor and for the rest of human time as long as that word is used influence greatly the
actions that people take. I'm a big proponent of taking what is true and commonly known
these days, but no one uses it because there's no word for the simple actionable action and
malign a word for it, in the hopes that people then actually do the thing they know of.
Everyone knows that science exists, but no one goddamn does it. If we can start to take little
chunks of usefulness out of it, which is science, then people can get the advantages of doing
them.

Social Media

Reddit and the psychology of groups

There is a website called Reddit, and it's quite popular. In the past, what you saw of the
world was pretty much filtered through another person. If you read the newspaper, you've
read words written by another person, filtered through his editor and onward down the
chain until the ideas eventually reached your mind. Because there was a constant overhead
and chokepoint of quality assurance people making sure that they weren't printing or
offering up crap to their customers, it took a long time to get content out, and it also dulled
down extreme ideas, because anytime two people cooperate or collaborate on something
for public consumption, they tend to damp each other and reach a middle more often than
they tend to combine, resonate and amplify. That is the reason that collaborations are more
effective for reducing failure than they are for achieving greatness or innovating.

It just amplifies and dulls different activities. Why is the best art never created by a
committee? Why is the best food never created by a committee? How about film scripts,
books? It seems like the most effective unit to operate under for any of these activities is
the individual. That is not to say that it will always be that way.

Anyway, Reddit is great because it allows the readers themselves to be the curators of the
content and assure that the quality is there. It has its own negative side effects, in that as a
subject becomes popular and attracts a lower and lower common denominator of person,
you get less and less unique and intelligent conversation, and more and more puns and
memes.

If I wanted to hear bad puns, I'd read YouTube comments, then hang myself. What happens
basically is the continual birth and death of socially curated and socially generated mediums,
as they are born fresh and clean with a tight focus and minimal distraction. They dilute over
time, where you just can't stand to read another pun, and you head on to the next
community. This isn't just how online communities operate, it's also how real human
societies operate. Once a place is too crowded, it's time to go, once the quality wanes, it's
time to move on!

The point is, as your online community gains humor and general interest value, it will attract
more people that are there to take the bounty and have less to give. When it was a barren
wasteland, only the very motivated, and likely therefore to be very outlying and
knowledgeable, or driven, in the area would congregate there. Thus, a less interesting to the
layman, and less funny forum, will have a higher signal to noise. If you want funny, please,
there's lots of greats places for that. Puns are the lowest form of comedy.



Unless you have asshole moderators, wherever you enjoy going now, you will enjoy less
over time, unless perhaps, it is you that is the cancer, and has nothing on topic to offer.

Delete Facebook

Let's be serious, you're friends with all the people that you don't like enough to actually text
with and meet up with. Your actual group of people you want to tell about the new bad ass
thing that you read or saw, and you really care about their opinion of, it is a shit load smaller
than the number of Facebook friends you likely have. How shall you have room to make new
bad ass friends when you take up all your time learning about the weak and rather boring
lives of all those you don't even really want to have a coffee with?

Measure what you're really getting out of Facebook and news reading, what have you
gotten in the last couple years out of it? What could you do instead? If you have 700 friends
and really care about 50, aren't the other 650 more harm than good (unless you have
learned the magic of the hide button, so they think you care, but really you never see their
stuff)?

Social media psychosis - the paperclip maximizer takes form as the selfie maximizing human /
machine hybrid

Some people are worried that we’ll accidentally create a machine that becomes super
powerful, however due to lazy programming, decides the best thing it can do in the universe
is turn every piece of matter it can find into a paperclip. Funny enough, we haven't built a
paperclip maximizer, but we did build a selfie maximizer. Facebook and all the other social
media sites have transformed our youth into selfie generating machines. It appears the
singular most important thing to the adults of the future is looking cool in photos of
themselves. The more time you spend taking pictures of yourself, the less time you are
being yourself. If the thing you focus most on in the world is your image, you'll find the
person behind that image decays from neglect.

Bathroom selfies

Flush the toilet, and flush your camera. You are alone, in your bathroom, there is no way,
this can make you look cool. STOP!

Inclusionism Works
Cooperation

More perverse incentives. Why must we all keep our greatest ideas secret, so that no one
else runs with and executes to our detriment? If you could make a lower barrier to entry,
profitable collaboration, or set a standard by which idea givers were commonly rewarded,








people may be less secretive. This isn't just a corporate problem, this is a science problem as
well. Publish or perish? Well, better keep those good research ideas to yourself. How many
websites have you been on that desperately needed improvement, yet you kept your ideas
a secret?

Tolerance is terrible

What sucks, sucks - and if you let the people that do suck know that you're punishing the
suck less, guess what, you'll get more suck. This whole "love the person killing you" thing
only exists in cultures that are so far isolated from the real world they think they're saving,
that they have no idea what they're getting into, how could they? They live in a beautiful
place, because it's free of the very people that made the other place suck. Guess what they
do, they bring the suck over here, perhaps dividing the suck because suck rubs off on you
when you're near it. Even great honest men are ruined by proximity to the suck. Why do you
think the police in America are so violent compared to the police in the UK? Because the
police in America are getting kicked, teeth knocked out, stabbed, maced, you name it,
basically just because they had to pull you over for a traffic violation.

When you work in the country that has some of the most violent crimes, and you work with
the worst of the worst all day long, you too are going to become hardened and that
hardiness isn't going to turn off and on based on the lifestyle choices of the person you've
pulled over. You could pull over a 90-year-old grandmother and ask her nice questions such
as do you have over 10k in the car? Where have you been tonight, where are you going, do
you do that often? Why are you really out here? Ask a tricky compound question like, do
you want to get out over here without a ticket, can I search your car?

If you say yes to the first part, he will assume the second part was answered yes as well, and
get away with it. If you say no, you're lying, of course you don't want a ticket. How did we
end up in a world where the police have figured out on their own or been trained to use
confusing language to screw you out of your right to be searched without reasonable
suspicion (which is easier to achieve than probable cause)? If you won't let me search your
car, I can call the dog out and it will be about 30 minutes before it gets here, and if it alerts
me, I can search your car anyway.

Being inclusionist works well

Being an inclusionist works really well. You reap the rewards of including people that are
productive and awesome that you might have otherwise easily excluded due to overzealous
exclusion, however, you should be excluding some people, like criminals. Criminals get
excluded into little cells where no one gets to interact with them. There are some people in
the world whose behaviors and ideas are horrible, truly, literally horrible and they should be
excluded. Xx What does 'an inclusionist' mean?

Helping Others

Social programming

If you wanted to be prepared for the most dangerous animal you could ever encounter, now
you understand why we're so social. Since humans are the most dangerous things on the
planet, it's great that we are preprogrammed to really, really care about other humans (this
make them less likely to harm us). Imagine a world where you didn't have an inclination to
get along with your fellow man. If they could get away with it, perhaps they just kill you
when no one is looking, to see what it's like to watch a man die.



The takeaway is that not only is social stuff great for teamwork, but it's great for survival. If
you hear a bump in the night, the worst case is that it's another human, more so than a wild
animal.

True Responsibility

True Responsibility- A Tony Robbins Story

Tony Robbins' speech actually, he told a story about a guy who was in a terrible motorcycle
accident, became a paraplegic and was burned over 80 % of his body and could only use one
arm or some shit. He's harsh and insanely hard, his father was hard on him, and his father
made him accept responsibility for shit that truly didn't seem fair to him, things that
obviously weren't his fault, weren't his problem. One day he borrowed his father's car and
someone rear ended him. His father made him pay to fix it and that didn't seem fair to him
at all. After he was burned and slid under a tractor trailer, he found out that what his father
taught him, about accepting responsibility allowed him to feel better about whatever
happened to him in his life, so he chose to ride that motorcycle, he chose to ride that speed,
he chose to ride that day, he chose to turn the bike over and now he is in the position he's
in, and he gets to choose his future. He gets to choose whether he kills himself or whether
he can make the best of it he can, so he went to become the mayor of a city, married a
beautiful girl, all of these wonderful things because he learned what true responsibility
meant.

Communication

Effective Speech

Tropes and punch lines

I'm not sure if that's how great writers or screenwriters write, but it seems like the
parts that make movies good are those little magic moments, those little tropes, the
ideas. In the movie The Shining, when she discovers that all the work on the novel has
actually been typing the same crazy shit over and over again, the writer probably
came up with that idea. I'm probably just projecting here, so I'll just say that if I were
to write some type of badass screen play or book -1 would look for those tropes and
then work backwards into them. Start with the punch line and then work backwards
into it. Him writing that novel, typing the same thing a million times, that's the
punchline. Her walking up to it, discovering it and just being curious, that's the lead
up. Which of those two things is the important part? The part where someone walks
up to a typewriter and checks on the other person's work?


No. If that were funny, that would be causing all types of joy and laughter all over
every office, every day, everywhere in the world. The important part is the punch line,
think the same thing goes when you're writing a book about ideas, it's the punch
ines that matter and then you lead up to them. Hypothetically, in my imagination,
Stephen King has an idea, such as wouldn't it be crazy if a family went to some like
deserted place that was creepy and then one of them went ass crazy? Then, while they
were trying to protect the kid, the kid seemed even slightly crazier in a metaphysical
sense. That one person got possessed by a good external, like demon angel force, and
then the other one got possessed by a bad external demon angel force.


How would we lead up to that? alright well we'll give the guy job we'll give him a wife
and we'll make them seem like you know normal functioning people. On down the list.
How much a part of that movie was the crazy being a metaphysical? I don't think
that's the interesting part of the film. I think the interesting part is that there's no























protagonist there, there's no conscious motive or action on the part of that
"character", right. The supernatural force doesn't have a desire. It doesn't have
anything standing in its way. It's just basically a stupid distraction as far as I'm
concerned. Whereas your loved one falling apart wanting to fucking kill you, that is a
very easy to understand motive. What does he want? He wants to fucking kill you.
Why does he want it? He's fucking crazy. That's very easy to understand and very easy
to feel as another human being. Like some kid riding around on a fucking tricycle
seeing weird shit. Cool, like can you see the lottery numbers buddy? Sweet you're my
new best friend. Xx Are these last two paragraphs necessary? Confusing and I don't
think provide additional value

Quorum

Maybe people's inherent need to take the other side of the position and be generally
cock-blocky reduces human beings' divergence down paths that are silly. It requires a
quorum, so to speak. It's basically friction for behavior. Behavioral opportunity costs
like, mod. Xx What does quorum mean? What is 'mod'?

Effective with Speech

I think both Schopenhauer and some Greek dude had writings on how to be more
effective in speech. Even if you shouldn't be effective, the stupids still believe you. I
would imagine that it’s abuse of the common human misconceptions such as ad
hominem and appeal to authority and other biases, sunk cost fallacy and the such.

Interpersonal communication
Punch lines

Punch lines are called punchlines, not caress lines, for example, because they have to
hit fast and hard. That's what makes them funny. It's a giant switch inside the
meanings inside the person's head. That's the difference between a funny joke and
not a joke.

I thought it was common knowledge that if someone is telling a story, don't try and

Communication(Org me xx)

Touch is worth like ten talking points. When someone touches you, you have two options:
either physically do the socially uncomfortable thing and tell them to take their hand off
you, or remove yourself from the hand. I like to forcefully remove the hand from me,
because it shows dominance on my part. Your other option is that you're going to override
the discomfort with believing what they say more. Some people take the socially harder,
more adrenaline rush in conflict. Some people will take the I'm OK with this conflict and I
feel the discomfort go away more, the more I agree with what you say. What you end up
with is that if you see people that are very proficient with the ladies, they end up touching a
lot to the point where they look like creepy molest dudes to normal Scandinavian
understanding. If you want to be differently effective with some people, try implementing
touch earlier in the right amounts in socially acceptable ways. It changes from daytime to
nighttime, changes with levels of attraction and respect change with the peer group,
changes with what bar you're in, changes with how many drinks everyone's had. However, if
you want to talk to a person's soul and really get to know that person, there's nothing more
personal than touch. That's where kids come from. That's where you came from, touch is a
big deal. I would be willing to say that there are effects you can have on another human
being through touch that you can't have any other way. If you want to live the fullest and
greatest life, you probably need to find the best touch from other people towards you.

To enjoy the best touch from you to other people, maybe you like to add even more people
to the mix. Maybe some group hug is awesome for you, maybe it was awesome for you. I
think human touch is going to be more and more neglected part of the human experience
the more and more digital our lives become, when you're more interested in taking selfies
and promoting the image of your digital self, particular to people you will never meet,
followers that you will never meet and if you met them, you sometimes would wish that you
had not.

Just because someone follows or likes your picture, doesn't mean that you would like or
follow them in the real world, for you see, following wasn't invented in the digital age. In the
world, you could actually follow another human being and that's kind of where the word
attraction comes from. Someone's truly attractive, by definition, when you want to be closer
to them. Literally they attract you like a magnet. You're turned on by something that is going
on there. You will spend money, time, effort, compete, do whatever is necessary to be
closer to that person. It's not only people in this world that are attractive, they are things to



a lot of people, like beaches. There are sharks in the water, but they still like beaches,
because to a lot of people, beaches are attractive.


What you'll find with the most really, really smart effective people is that they shut up when
they're talking to someone else unless they know something good is going to come out of
that talking. Sometimes you'll see an interview where there's a comedian interviewing a
genius. Now, I'll actually give you an example of an interview. I saw the guy who makes
Robot Chicken, I believe his last name is Green. He's hilarious and has a very successful
history of both acting and more importantly, writing hilarious things. He was interviewing
Peter Diamandis, who is a MIT graduate, physician, insanely successful intelligent as fuck guy
who is part of the human longevity project, which is probably one of the best projects on
the planet currently. He was part of XPrize to get space flight going, which, who knows,
maybe that influenced Elon Musk to start SpaceX. He isn't perfect, but boy, he is doing a
million times better job than most of us, including myself. There was an interview between
these two and every time Peter Diamandis would want to teach a cool idea, talk about some
shit people didn't know about and talk about the future, Mr. Green wanted to be funny and
as a result, take up a lot of time and interrupt him.

You can see that poor Peter was getting super pissed off, because he saw that literally the
thing he wanted to do was make the world a better place, and maybe seem like a smart guy.
What the other guy wanted to do was be funny and be funny personably - be the guy that
was causing the funny and be identified for it. That conflict between those two was obvious
and made the interview highly uncomfortable. Why am I telling this? Because Peter, in my
opinion, tried to do the right thing and shut up enough to not lose the crowd, not have
conflict and restrict what he was saying to maybe shit that would have less hooking, funny
points that the funny guy could get in on. Maybe it's not the world's best example, but it's a
good example of as you become more intelligent and have less ego around those that talk to
you, or have huge ego, but just shut up because no one else cares about you promoting
yourself. As you become more intelligent, you learn to shut up, because when you're
shutting up, you can learn and have more useful shit to say.

I'm speaking quickly. Is your mission to cause understanding in the person that you're
speaking to? If so, slow down! The problem with getting people to understand things isn't
that you're not shitting enough data at them, it's that they need to understand it better. The
faster you speak and the more hard to understand things you say at them, the harder it
gets. Notice the word at - it's at, if the ideas are bouncing off and making it harder, instead
of easier, for them to understand. I will use the word to, not because it's more positionally
accurate, but because it’s more commonly understood to be a positive interaction when you
speak with or to someone rather than at. At is very self-focused, it only cares about the
transmission, not the receiving. It's basically the spam of the speaking world, whereas
speaking with someone implies that it's a two-way conversation, which unfortunately can be
painful when one person is trying to educate another. If a teacher in the classroom keeps
getting interrupted by the students wanting to say shit, at the end of the day you will
discover that he didn't get to teach much because those with less information took up more
of the communication space than the people with more information. It’s folly to assume
that all communicative events have the same value, as it is folly to assume that all
measurements are as accurate, all interventions are as accurate, all light was the same color
is a world of nuance and difference. For those of us that use words, just the smallest



difference in tonality or word choice leads to great differences in understanding, especially
if you're talking in a language that's new to the other person; they could not understand half
of what you say because they just don't know those words. The English language has the
most words that human beings are aware of, and as such it has the most opportunities for
you to choose a word that the other guy has no idea what you're saying.

Back to the speed of speech. The faster you speak, the less influential you are. If you don't
change the rate at which you speak based on the up time and measurement of the
understanding of the person that you're speaking to, you're doing both of them and yourself
a disservice. You will seem like a needy, whiny little bitch who needs people's approval so
desperately that you'll speak quicker and quicker as you notice that they don't agree with
what you're saying, and they're not giving you significance of what you're saying. We as
human beings are programmed to value the person in need as less useful and less powerful
than the person who is reactive and comes from a space of fulfillment.

What’s the downside to this? The downside to this is that it allows dumb people, who don't
have anything to say, but say it in a deep voice and slowly, to take lots more respect and
influence than they deserve to, because we're all programmed to respond to that style of
interaction. It's an unfortunate consequence of powerfulness of speaking slowly that day to
rates are artificially slow and the time must be wasted honoring ideas that aren't great in
order to buy compliance and influence for the ideas that could be considered great. Xx What
should the word in yellow be?

The artful implementation of vulnerability where you're not going to get the shit cock
blocked out of you, probably generates some power that can't be had any other way.

Trust used to be much, much more valuable, and the rates at which you could check
people's trustworthiness were much lower. Progress in recording technology and
transportation speed has made trustworthiness less valuable, because now we can verify
things in real time. At least, most of them.

Dealing with moderators

Since they get attacked all day long, any suggestion you make will be considered an attack.
The default position is that you are the enemy. Only lots of ass kissing seems to work with
these folks. Chances are, if you're speaking to a moderator at all, you're probably going to
have a bad time. Like the police of the real world, when you deal with assholes all day, it
tends to affect your demeanor negatively.


Writing

Tips to make writing happen

If you don't want to write, but you like arguing with people, try pretending that you are
arguing against yourself, you might be able to trigger the reward that comes from thinking
you're gaining social value, but really you're just gaining value against yourself. (I have not
tried this yet, perhaps you could visualize arguing with a different person that wasn't
yourself as well, to trigger the reward for the effort of writing.)

Selling

Communication tactics

Ambiguity in communication

Ambiguity is your friend and advertisement that peaks interest has an unanswered
question, a curiosity that only a visitor purchase can solve, (xx might copy in
money/business/marketing as well.

It's the same as when you're texting people or trying to have an influence. What they
don't know and what they imagined is at least as powerful and at least as compelling,
because it's already in their head and from themselves, as anything that you try to
transmit. Whatever you transmit, you're lucky if it gets received, processed and has
the effect that you hoped.

If it comes from them, it doesn't need received, doesn't need processed, doesn't need
to go through the same filters that your output does. It's faster, works better, it's
cleaner. I would call it mental negative space. The blanks that they fill in that you set
the framework around, but they really painted in the boxes. Paint by numbers - you're
setting up the numbers and they're doing the painting.

Idea came from them

There's a saying that "It’s much easier to fool a man than to show a man that he's
been fooled". I think it's that same; did they fill in the blanks, did they fill in the
negative space? Now you combine the concept, the idea that they think came from
them, they have to defend and fight for, because it came from them, so it's got to be
good, or people will like them less. I think that's why it's easier to fool people than it is
to show them they've been fooled.

Pattern interrupts, the escape hatch to better feelings.

Sometimes the outside world wakes you up in ways you didn't expect!

There's nothing like the self-awareness that comes from doing a ninja roll off
your bike from hitting an unexpected curb or whatever. Nothing like hitting a
curb and being like "Yep, Ninja roll, meant to do that shit, meant to totally roll
off the bike here." You're doing something you're used to doing, and something
unexpected happens, it breaks you out of your normal pattern and gives you the
chance to see the world in a new way, perhaps from the view from the
pavement to the sky.

You can use pattern interrupts to stop people from running the same
disempowering patterns they're used to. For instance, if someone is about to go
into their terrible story about how life is so unfair to them, you could ask them,
"I'm really interested in that, can you tell me real quick, have you ever drank
pizza through a straw?" Then give them a little playful push, or tap, whatever it
takes to reset them off the old, shitty disempowering path. A reset gives you a
chance to stick something better in there. It's important to follow up with a new
good path. You only open the door, you have to get them to step through, lead
them to a better place.

Truth finding - interrogation tactics




Should go into interrogation tactics and truth finding tactics for fun presupposition,
setting the angles up for them to want to lie.

Lying to find truth
Lying about

What you know

What their conspirator in another room said

How you can help them only if they say they did it, forjudge leniency
Saying you can help them only if they say they did it for the people they
harmed not to bring charges (which is usually not up to the victims
anyway, as it's a crime against the state, not a civil crime against the
person.)

(xx wat....) Having the attention other humans
Focus on the recipient
The Past Poisoning your future QW.405-407
Giving Advice or Suggestions

You can influence people that don’t know you exist, you can also have multiple identities
too

Be a lighthouse before a spotlight.

The value of making new "classics"

(xx spirit) How you feel about things, has more to do with your recent experience than you think.
Male vs female sentencing: Effect of having eaten or being on period, or time of day on
sentencing harshness (this is an actual study re after lunch sentencing) why wouldn't the
obvious satiation and satisfaction of a human affect their decision making and desire to
affect retributive sentences on other humans.

Bosses

Because our perceptions are so easily influenced by what we want to believe, it's very easy
for bosses and employees to work together better. This is because the boss can tell you
what you should do. Because he doesn't have to do it, he can be truthful about what you
should do. But you, the person, actually has to do it. You give a shit a little bit less about
what you should do and more about what you can kind of get away with it or would be good
enough for would be okay. For people that actually got to do the work best is often not an
option, but for people that can sit in fancy chairs and just dream up tasks for faceless
masses to just do. You know for them best is a lot more affordable, emotionally.

Demand respect

you can pay people to do as you wish even if they don't respect you, so respect is a way
people can be influenced for free'ish. If you want to move a man, you must already know
what he's moved.

Arguing

Fun rhetorical tactics

That which can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

Add new influences as you would add new understandings

If you know what already influences someone, you can bridge that to what new thing you
want to influence them. This is the same way that we peg new understanding to things
already understood. In this case, we're just switching understanding for influence. We peg
the new influences to the sites where the old influences were docked, or if they're useful,
we dock right on top of them.

Reach billions if you speak the language of the masses



I had my sights set on writing the best self-help book and using Think and Grow Rich; Richest
Man of Babylon; How to Win Friends and Influence People; The Secret; Rich Dad, Poor Dad;
Four Hour Work Week and etc. as the benchmark for the maximum impact that you could
have in the self-help space. Now, through the deep study of what is possible, what does
exist and what has existed, I see that you can reach billions of people instead of millions,
you can engage them for hundreds of hours instead of a couple and that you can addict
them 10 times harder, if only you speak the language that they speak; the language of
fiction, the language of myth, the ark of story, a relatable protagonist - the language that
human beings have been programmed to be receptive to since before the written word
existed.

Stories have existed for longer than writing. Speech has existed for longer than writing and
social structure, respect, reciprocity and knowing what's important and what's not, feeling
fear and not, and feeling that you're a member of something greater than yourself. Altruism
precedes history, writing and likely precedes much of math, probably anything past addition
and subtraction. If you actually care about making the most impact on the people of this
planet, at this time, you need to speak the language that they speak and that they prove
that they are most receptive to. Sadly, that language is not an honest language. Sadly that
language is a very convoluted, very abstracted imaginary language. It's the language of shit
that never happened. If you were to measure the conscious input that goes into human's
brains and measure the ratio of things that actually happened and things that didn't
happen? You may find that that which didn't happen is a huge component.

Back when I was having a conversation with a friend about how to get people to stop cock¬
blocking and accept ideas or advice -they'll never do it, because they have a chip on their
shoulder - and I figured out, that the way to do it was by storytelling. You tell a parable or a
story that's not about them and not about you, but proves a point some other way, just like
a joke with a punchline. For example, the nurse is walking through the hospital, and she
pulls a rectal thermometer out of her coat pocket and goes, "Damn it! Someone has my
pen!" There's some other version of that joke where, basically it injects into your brain the
punchline that her pen is up somebody's ass because she has a thermometer that she was
supposed to be taking someone's temperature with.

The concept is that you can tell someone a story, they follow along, and then you hit them
with the punchline, which causes them to understand all at once, without them being able
to avoid and cock-block and do all of the other faggot-y bullshit that they would normally do
to avoid getting a fucking idea, or being caught getting the idea.

Do you read fiction? Do you listen to music? These things are not facts in the objective
world. These are permutations and combinations of human created things, and thus I think
that you're going to end up with a canon of work with an enemy, a hero, a path, learning,
self-discovery and betrayal and all of the other successful addictive tropes, hopefully
combined with accurate, educational, effective bad ass action performed by the
protagonists.

Knowing Universals before Specifics

The intelligent person only wants to build and promote ideas and show how ideas are the
universal frameworks that underlie things. However, just like martial arts class, they teach
you the katas, they teach you the strategies that you can use, they teach them in



individualities. They don't teach you the universal that they use to then permute out into
the strategies, because they're too vague and they're too un-actionable. It's through the
same vague and un-actionality of knowing universals before specifics.

It's why that vagueness and that un-actionability is the densest, most easy to manipulate,
greatest way for me to think about things, but for people that come from a different place
that don't have the capacity to write their own self-help books, and haven't had a decade to
spend just learning cool and interesting things, to assume that they would help me the most
dense format would be similar to what would help them is obviously false. What's going to
help these people is to not see the underlying universals. Maybe you could mention them in
passing if you wish to. You need to focus on the things that can fit in their brain, mesh with
the mind space they come from, and are actionable. Xx Revise beginning, hard to
understand

You don't make sense to other people

If you played football in high school, you're going to love professional football a lot more,
because it has more detail and nuance to you. If you focus on the flavors of the food you
eat, you're going to have a better time eating nearly anything because that's what you're
looking at. If you're a guy that builds ideas and is intrigued by universal truths, comparing
and contrasting, specificity, really getting things right and not leaving cracks for a weakness
for people to attack, then you're going to appreciate a new sentence or a new idea. It will be
totally lost on other people that don't have that mind space. If you're an artist and you say,
"Hey. Look at the way that I used this brush." Or, "Look at the way that I mixed these
colors." There are some people in the word that don't literally have the same capacity to see
color that you do. You might be tri-chromatic, you might be able to see more colors than
they can see. Or, if it's digital media, you might be working on a screen that can show 100%
of a Dolby RGB and they can only see 100% of SRGB, maybe half the color space.

Consider sharing a piece of music with a friend or a piece of art with a friend, how often is it
that it just didn't have the impact that it had on you? You laughed for 20 minutes at
something, as did everyone else that saw it, which is a reason you discovered it. Then, you
show it to your girlfriend and she doesn't think that shit is funny at all. Now, does that make
it not funny? For her, yeah. For you and the other people that preceded you, no.

Two sides of the same coin is a lie

Coins have at least 3 sides. (Influence & Think (xx the examples, definitely get referenced in
marketing))

If you look at one side of the coin, do you know what's on the other side? Not really. You
only know what's on the other side if you look at it. It's like flipping a coin, it could land on
heads or it can land on tails. Actually, there's another side that every once in a while it does
land on; you can have a coin land on its edge. Sometimes if you drop a coin, you see it roll
away from you. That's because it landed on its edge; it didn't land heads, it didn't land tails,
it rolled away.

The point here is that you didn't even know the coin really had three sides when you first
looked at it, you never really considered the edge much. You didn't think about it possibly
being a coin with the other side ground off, or a trick coin where the other side was identical
to the side you are looking at. The more complex the thing is that you are looking at, the
more costly your false, but normally correct assumptions will be. Thus, it's not good enough



to get information "near" a thing. You must get the closest, most specific possible
information, or you will very likely get bad information. Bad information is much worse than
no information.


Here are some examples of people who you might think are qualified to give you some good
advice, but really, they are not.

Woman on getting laid

This is the same reason that if you were to ask a girl, "What's the best way to
make you fall in love with me?" They could answer you, they can try and answer
you truthfully. Whatever answer they give you will be entirely wrong because
there's nobody in the world that probably has less experience getting girls to fall
in love with them than that girl.

Customers on being sold

It is the same thing with sales. If you were to ask your customer, "Hey Mr.
Customer, what's the best way to sell you this thing?" He's going to tell you,
"Give me the best features and the best product at the lowest price." when in
reality that's not the case. It might be to tie your product to Michael Jordan, it
might be to put a limited time offer on your product or it might be to add
something to the purchase of your product like McDonald's did with their Happy
Meals including a little game piece for a game. There's all types of different
ways to sell a thing and the people who know those things are the sales men.
People who don't know these things are the people on the other side of the
transaction, the purchasers. Why am I telling all of this to you? In this life, the
best way to teach people a thing is to relate to what they already know, which is
basically what you're doing when you're speaking to them in a language - you're
not speaking to them in a language they don't speak, you're speaking to them in
a language they do speak. If you believe as you should, that you must speak the
language that people understand, then it’s in your best interest to use analogies
that are the simplest, most agreeable, most understandable that can get your
point across.

Ideas that are related, but in actual use, lead to massively different outcomes
Focusing on what you want vs what you don't want

The solution to dieting is not concentrating on dieting, it’s concentrating
on good food. The good food idea cannot be found on the bad food coin.

Make easy analogies to help people understand.

If someone needs to hit up a dictionary before they can understand your analogy, you're
doing more harm than good.

For instance, Richard Dawkins decided to say that ideas were like genes and that as
genes find their way to be executed in reality through living beings, so do ideas find
their way to get executed into reality through living beings as well. The problem with
his analogy is that no one understands biology and phylogeny, all of these fancy ass
words. It's hard to understand genes, it's hard to understand mutation and it's hard to
understand recessive and dominant traits, that shit is all complicated. Therefore,
trying to understand the way knowledge travels in the world using a harder to
understand biological parable or analogy is stupid.



So, I have invented the idea of an ideological invasive species. That's much easier to
understand because people know what an invasive species does; it comes in and it
fucks up all the other things that are there, because it developed in a more hardcore
place. In order to survive in that hardcore place, it had to be super badass. Then it
comes into Lazyville, which is wherever the species is that haven't had to become as
badass are, and it goes there and it fucks them all up. You see that same thing with
ideas. That's what capitalism did to basically all the other ideas in the world.

Having the attention of other humans

Impact the world

If you want to make an impact in the world and you want to make it by being in the
radar, in the ears of, through the eyes of, in the hands of other humans beings, I want
you to look at those other human beings and measure the ratio of input that hits them
through loved ones and friends compared to through mass media and marketing.

What I think what you'll find is an increasing amount to the ever more increasing
digital age. The amount of a person's personal ear time, brain time, eye time and
thought time is much greater effected by the mass media, by the Internet than it is by
their actual friends. If that's the case, then it means that you can afford to market to
your friends. Then, you might not have the impact on them that you otherwise can
have.

Influencing the movers and shakers

If you want to affect the movers and shakers of the world, then you need to get your
message into their brain. These guys have limited time spans, because they're so
addicted to making the next dollar. Or, in their vision, they don't see it that way. When
Fortune does their 400 richest list, and they interview these guys, a lot of the guys
hate them. They're like, "You think we just sit around here and think about how much
money we have? We're trying to do the next thing." And their response is like, "No,
that's our job. We'll think about how much money you have. It's okay." I think that
was the Koch brothers' response like two, three years ago.

If you want to influence people that can make an impact in the world, and you believe
the numbers that 1% of the world controls 80% of the wealth or more, then that 1% is
the percent that matters. That's a little bit misleading because apparently, if you're
making more than 35 grand a year, you're in the 1%. But even in that subset, the 1%
of that subset is massively more powerful than the rest.

Reaching the 1%

If you're in America, you're already in the 1% probably. Then, if you're in
America, the 1% in America makes you look as stupid as you made
everyone else look. That's how fucked up the income distribution is. If
those were the people that need to be reached - let's just look at that.

This shit's important enough actually to make sure we got it right. Is it fair
to say that the 1% is who needs to be reached? Is that fair to say? I think it
is. Well, there's three goals, and they pay off at different times. And it's
really more than three, depends on how you chunk them.

Influence your friends

In summary, if you want to have an impact on this world and you don't have enough
money, you can pretty much fuck yourself, because the world isn't paying attention to
what it should be. The world is paying attention to what it wants, and on the other



side of that one is a well-oiled multibillion dollar machine built to addict, built to
consume, built to give them what they want regardless of what is or not. If you want
to influence your friends, your family and you then you need the money to
outcompete those other experts that have taken over your consciousness.

Money is just part of the question

Interestingly enough, money is only one part of the equation. A lot of movies are
made for 100 millions of dollars and no one watches them. If they did watch them,
they actually sucked. Having money is one part of the equation, having a good, sticky
message that matters and pays them benefits from following it, that's the other half.
Lots of money in with a shitty message that no one cares about, is false or harmful or
whatever. You should get fucked and it should be burned money, but a great idea that
no one ever hears about isn't good either.

Learning is similar to cryptography

Learning is similar to cryptography and that there's one way functions. Sometimes it's
a lot easier to create an idea and tell it to somebody. Then amount of time it takes
them to digest it is longer, and not log rhythmically longer, but at least learning early
longer, so that an hour of your speaking might be six to eight hours of their
understanding and depending on the difficulty of the material, they may never
understand. They may not have the tools that would be requisite beforehand to have
truly understood, what you were building on top of.

Business of influencing others

If I had to give advice for other speakers, system designers, educators or people that
are in the business of influencing others, perhaps even yourself- internal influence,
self-influence - I would say, if you're not going to execute every single possible part of
a plan to the letter like a recipe that you've maybe done for the first time, then give
yourself some leeway with some broad strokes and you're going to get a lot more
distance than getting hung up on something that didn't really matter that much
anyway.

How to tell good stories

Let's say that the world already has a religion, but you want them to follow yours
because it pays nice. You eat for free. Everyone loves you. Everyone respects you.
You'll be the most protected in a time of war. You'll be the most protected in a time of
famine. You know, if you have a normal human wiring to be significant, being a
religious leader or in between people and God, or an advisor to people in regards to
the most important thing that they can think of in the universe, which for many, many
people is God? How would you get rid of the old and institute the new?

There's a pretty limited number of strategies. You can kill your way through, but in
order to do that, you've got to be more than a good story teller. In order to kill your
way through, you've got to be a bad ass killing machine that can recruit, influence,
control and maintain order with other bad ass killing machines to kill so many people
that the people that are left are like, "You know what? I would rather believe this new
cool story and stay alive than believe the old cold story. Cool story. And, it's funny if
you think about what it takes to worship most religions.

They promise you the sun, the stars, the moon, eternal ecstasy in a place that's so
good it can't even be described. They promise that to you. It's advanced fee fraud. It's



a Nigerian scam. Their cousin has a billion, zillion dollars that they're going to give to
you for some weird reason they made up, you just need to give them the money to
pay the Western Union guy off, or to pay the public official off, or whatever excuse it
takes to get you to give in order that you receive in the future this thing that you have
assigned value to.

Guess what? A confidence man, a con-artist, is not someone who gets your
confidence. It's a misunderstanding. A confidence man, a confidence artist, gives you
his confidence, and then you feel so privileged to have it, you see such value in it
because you think he is a valuable person, and you are privileged to have him believe
in you and offer you something that you will pay now in order to maintain that
relationship. So a confidence man doesn't want your confidence. He wants to give you
his.

Human beings are reciprocal and we believe in reciprocity, due to it being an effective
game strategy. I don't like the way that sounds, I'm never going to use it again. Fuck
that game strategy bullshit. Life is not a game. Life is the most important thing in the
world, and let's not demean it by calling it a game. We're going to edit that statement
and say that the reason reciprocity exists is something that we as people do - I'm just
going to use the word people instead of humans now, because we're going to get out
of that techno babble bullshit, and we're going to the heart of what everyone really
knows to be true.

Effective storytelling

There are effective storytelling techniques that were included. What I believe that you
will see with the passage of time, is an increase in the offers provided by these
religions and a decrease on the shit you have to do. This is assuming some cataclysmic
event doesn't wipe out all human history, but if human history continues, and people
are aware of the religion they're currently in and the religions that existed previously,
if you want to out-compete the religion that people are already in, which almost
everyone is in one throughout the history of mankind, at different levels of
advancement.

If they don't offer you more and make you work less, they can't out compete the
other religions that already have market share. I'm not sure if I'm the person that
coined this, but applying inflationary economics to belief systems and understanding
that over time they will just continue to inflate to the point of absurdity, like
Zimbabwe where there's trillion dollar bills that you are better off lighting on fire for
warmth than you are trying to buy anything with. That's the result of needing to
continuously increase the fantasy pay off of the fantasy work that people are doing.

Be proud of what you invented

It's really fun to be proud of what you came up with, what you invented and what's
novel that you did. It gives you a sense of significance, importance and achievement,
and that's fabulous. On the other hand, if you're in the business of influencing other
people, such as the education business or the motivation business - maybe what your
clients and what your customers and what your students need isn't what you have
uniquely created, which is a very, very small subset of all the things that have been
created before you and after that act of creation - we could call it procreation.



Then it would be better off for you and your students, those that listen to you and are
influenced by you to be exposed to the message that they need to hear, regardless of
whether you're the source and origin of it or not. It would be a terrible tragedy for
math teachers to not teach algebra, addition or subtraction because they didn't invent
them. To only talk about this new thing that you could never even understand, that's
at the limit of understanding because you were deprived of the things, the
prerequisites of understanding it, because no one wanted to teach them to you
because the people talking to you didn't invent them. The people that invented them
are long dead.

Thousand different technique

The most important part of writing a book isn't to present all the data you have on a
thing, because in an ideal world, where one has a shitload of memory and a shitload
of internet access - they already have access to everything in the world. What they
need from you is less, not more. They don't need more data, they need less data. You
need to refine and hone their limited attention span on something that is truly
beneficial to them, not to tell them a million things to confuse the issue. You don't
need to fear the man that can do a thousand different techniques, you need to fear
the man that can do one very well.

Give people what they need

Giving people what they want is not giving them what they need. Giving them what
they want is making them fat, killing them, addicting them, making them non-creative
and making them non-productive.

Effective communication

Effective communication, over complexifying things to look smart is the opposite of
smart. Use the cheaper word. It's hard enough to get people do anything in this world,
especially if I have to Google what you have said.

Giving pledge

Regarding the giving pledge. It's good enough for the richest man in the world to try
and influence his peers, and influence you. If you want to have an impact on this
world, you can do it through a business, that will get you millions, it's how you can
legally control other people's lives, not just your employees. You control their lives,
you choose what they spend during their day, if you give them work, a good work
environment, and a good goal, you can really enrich their lives, make them feel pride,
make them feel good, let them know they're doing something good for the world.

Timing control

Examine a sports player, which I consider to be the entertainment industry, and you
see how many people they influence or control in the world, other than to convince
other people to do the exact same sport thing that they're doing. The only influence
that I can see them having is over perhaps their maid, whatever house staff they
might have, maybe a driver. Then I found this weird mechanic by which if you make
enough money, then the money that you have, if you spend it, then you control things
but in the past.

If you buy a really expensive house, you end up having increased the likelihood that
the people that put all the work into that house to create it, ended up going and doing
that thing hoping for the same reward. You didn't control them during the process,
and you didn't control them before the process, but you controlled them after the
process assuming that they'll continue the same type of behavior hoping for the same



type of reward. The discovery is that there's something called reverse timing control,
and you do it just by buying stuff.

Stop absorbing, start producing

The summary is, if you want to make an impact in this world, stop absorbing and start
producing unless you're a fucking retard and do some more absorbing then. Look, not
everyone has earned the right to be heard. A lot of people would do harm, more harm
than good, spreading their terrible ideas.

What is the highest outcome

The reason I tell you this, if the thing that you want to influence in this world is the
human being, and that your highest and best outcome is to create a better world, a
better life and a better outcome for other human beings quite similar to yourself, you
must influence them through the channels that exist and only through those channels.
They are two armed, two legged, two eyed, feel love, feel hate, they're humans as we
understand humans to be. If you want to lift up a rock, you have to grab the rock.

Can you grab it by proxy? Can you have something else grab it? Can you pretend air is
grabbing it but it's not really grabbing it? You have to interact physically with the thing
to move it and the channels by which you can move someone's understanding, desire
or belief are very finite and they're programmed. People have discovered and
experimented with and found odd and interesting ways to influence other people. My
point is, if you want to influence to the best degree possible human beings, then you
must take advantage of the thousands, if not hundred thousands, of years of
development and storytelling, trance and refinement of what human beings care
about, and which changes by culture, changes by time in the evolution of the being.

If you think that you're too good for above and beyond using the perfected,
optimized, thorough breed, most well rewarded financially tropes; meaning
strategies, ideas, imagery, form, shape, timing, pattern, structure, setting, theme all of
those things, which have been proven though billions and billions of dollars of
commerce in the past, great percentages of GDP - if you ignore the presence and
powerfulness of those things, it's very likely, you are creating a story that sucks and is
not interesting and no one should be interested in because it shouldn't speak to them.

In summary, if you want to influence other people, don't be a stuck up asshole. Look
to the past and look to see, what those addictive traits are, that are being used
successfully by people with less wholesome, less honest motives than I hope you
have. I hope if you're an evil piece of shit, you're not hearing my words. I hope if
you're an evil piece of shit, you're less effective in this world.

Us vs them

If an us versus them mentality is sometimes useful, then referring to how people not
with a cause are happy to die, might be one way to lightly tease them into action.

You may not be the best carrier of your own information

I'm telling you that there's an internal conflict inside yourself which are amongst 1)
the set of shit you would do ideally, 2) the set of shit you'll actually do, 3) then the
smaller sub set of shit that you'll actually do over a long enough period of time to get
the benefits you want, and then 4) we got another smaller set called shit you
convinced people to do, and then that set gets run through the same shit that yours



just did, because all you did was add to their big list and then it gets to their smaller
list and then it gets to their smaller list.

The actual amount of shit you can convince people to do for a long enough period of
time in their own life to improve their life is super small and probably an order of
magnitude smaller than what you can do for yourself. What's the point of all this? The
point of all this is once you know how few hours you really have to influence other
people, and once you know how little impact you really have on other people, you
better only bring you fucking A-game and you better only talk about what's important
to you.

I hope that you're advanced enough to know that what should be most important to
you, is the shit that might actually happen in the real world for that person. If you're
talking about shit that's just mentally interesting to you, you're wasting their time and
you're wasting your time, because it's not going to turn into worldwide action. If
you're talking about shit that's most proud to you because you're the guy that
invented it, maybe that's not what they need to hear. Maybe what they need to hear
is what's most profitable for them and might actually happen in their lives, and you
can shut the fuck up about you pride. Talking about what's on your mind and what
you saw in the news when you can save someone's life out there if you paid attention
to them, your audience, in a selfless manner or even yourself in a shelfful matter.

What could this person do that might benefit your life? What could that person do
that could benefit their life? Let's not talk about trivia and stupid bullshit that no one
cares about, or that's already been done a million times. If you want people to do
drugs, give them a book by Timothy Leary, he probably sold it better than you did. If
you want people to lift weights, give them a book by Arnold Schwarzenegger, he'll
probably get better influence than you would. You may not be the best carrier of your
own information. As a matter of fact, people might dislike you enough that you telling
them to do the thing will make them not do the thing. You got to be really artful in
knowing who you are and how you are perceived, because you might do more harm
for the mission that you're trying to do in the world than good. If Kim Jong II started
talking about longevity research, longevity research would take a fucking hit because
that guy is an asshole. I mean, we're lucky enough that Hitler loving animals didn't
destroy animal love, because that guy fucked up a lot of shit.

Don't assume everyone else's world view or abilities are yours

The moral of the story is, don't assume everyone else's world view or abilities are
yours. Don't assume that what moves you and you think is compelling matters to
anyone else. You might be moved by logic, and that's why you're such a smart dude.
The rest of the world, the logic that they think they're moved by, it's not actually logic.
It's all types of fallacy, it's all types of silly. If you don't learn to speak that language,
you're never going to reach them. You're never going to change them. You'll only be
able to influence them by what already influences them, and it's a very stupid
assumption to believe that they're influenced by the same things that you are,
because they ended up with such a wildly different opinion in basically the presence
of all the same information.



There's a fancy philosophical theorem that states that if any two rational actors
communicate in a logical and effective way with each other long enough, and they
both operate from the same observable data, then assuming that the logic that
they're using is proper, then they must always come to the same conclusion. This is
because if you have the same data, and you have proper reasoning, you always will
come to the same conclusion regardless of your identity as the processor of the
information.

Created by an American theologian named Reinhold Niebuhr, born in 1892, died in
1971, and been adopted by alcoholics anonymous and other twelve step program,
and the best known form is "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the
difference." Similar to most other things in religion, they all have precursors of nearly
similar things that preceded them. So for instance, a Greek, I assume he was Greek, he
wrote, "Make the best use of what is in your power and take the rest as it happens.
Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.

Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions, in short, whatever is
our own doing. Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations,
or our public offices, or that is whatever is not our own doing. You're going to make a
much bigger impact in the world changing those that want to be changed than you are
trying to influence the un-influenceable. Not everyone will ever be able to understand
some of the things you understand if you've got a book like this in your hands, let
alone be influenced by a novice debater that maybe they only respond to identity.

Maybe they respond to you if you are 100 times richer than them. Maybe that's their
qualification for when they're willing to accept a new idea from somebody else.

Maybe they only accept ideas from spiritual leaders. Maybe they only accept ideas
from the weird voice in their head. Maybe they've locked out and they're not
interested in new ideas, they've got it all figured out. That happens to people in their
20s. As soon as people are 20, they know everything. 18-20. And then as they get
older, they realize, oh, the set of things I don't know is actually quite large. Specificity
is friend, when you tell someone something, and they have to take time to explain to
you that what you said could be understood more than one way. You made them
seem pedantic for asking, and you have to say the same thing you already said over
again, slightly different. If you're specific the first time, you have one statement, one
direction, instead of three statements in two directions.

If you weren't lucky enough to be speaking to someone that knows that what you said
could actually be understood more than one way, now you're even worse, and they
might only discover they need more info from you when it's already too late. Don't
leave the success of your influence through speech or writing up to the quality of your
listener. Speak clearly and with specificity, this is influence, speak clearly and you
won't have to repeat yourself. This is cool because it works for both speaking loudly,
and speaking specifically, e.g. volume and accuracy. Imagine a friend calls you and
says, "Hey man, that thing you wanted done might happen then around here
sometime, or maybe over there." It would probably be more confusing than useful to
be told such gibberish.



Focus on the recipient

Not all things amplify the same way and with some things you get diminishing returns
the more you do, and some things you get diminishing returns the more you do it,
except you get a huge pay-off and breakthrough at some future date. Science is that
latter thing, some types of artistic activity is that latter thing, even if you're trying to
create viral videos in the Internet, you got to throw a lot of shit at the wall. To tell you
the truth, there is no formula, there is no method by which to create viral things
because the recipient and their subjectivity, and what else you're competing within
the popular culture at the time, is as equally, if not more equally, important than the
idea that you're trying to spread. People that have had success virally, very often are
unable to ever create it again even though it is they that are the most successful
examples of a viral thing.

I guess, you could say it's similar to bands and musicians that made some amazing
music and now everything they make sucks and now the band is breaking up. Why is
that? It's because the understanding that we have about how to create that type of
excellence in the world is either so harshly ignorant of what is actually the effective
part, which is the recipient, the culture and the competition, and that we're only
focusing on the things that are actually easier to influence and measure, which is the
work product that you're creating, the words that you're using, the colors, the social.
Yes, you can try. Yes, it may work. It will only work if you try often.

My point is twofold: one, be mindful of the recipient, it is very often more important
than the producer or the transmitter. The receiver is often more important than the
transmitter. You can change either of them; you can change the framework, change
the delivery method, you can focus on transmitting, you can focus on receiving, but a
lot of things you can do on the outside of what is commonly done to a
misunderstanding of the components of their model. The next things that I was telling
you is that some things that you do more like. Well, it's qualitative differently. You
can't just change the quantity, it changes the quality. You can't just measure
something with a thermometer. Imagine that the thing you were measuring was just
slightly bigger than a thermometer. Now, the mass of the area that you're measuring
has been vastly affected by your measuring tool.

In life, you affect what you measure. You're not measuring all the things you could
measure. Your measurements have presuppositions. They're excluding other
measurable things. You're making value judgements before you make your first
measurements, judgements have already been made. Understand that some things
like your last rep, that's most of your gain, but doing 500 more reps doesn't help that
much. Is it important enough to do it up to the last rep? Yes. Is it important to push
that last rep as hard as you can? Yes. Is it important to do 500 more past that? No. It's
important you don't do that. You got to tear your muscles a little bit. You can actually
rip you bicep in half. Tearing your muscles too much, micro tears - good. Real tears,
macro tears - bad. Actually I'm not going to include any of this because it seems to
lobby for not being able to figure anything out and therefore not doing it. This shit
needs to be edited xx so that people can derive actionable usefulness out of it, not
more confusion and fear.

Giving Advice or Suggestions



The same way that I would tell you that you shouldn't try and become a very bad
version of Google, you should let Google do what it does best and you should do what
it can't, can't yet. That's the same way that you want to get better data from voters. I
don't just tell you, "Hey, don't teach memory skills, let the computers do that." I take
the fallback position, which is try to not teach memory skills if you don't have to. Or, if
you are going to teach them, at least teach them right, and hear some tactics that
work, because it's actually competition and excellence has been developed in the area
so let's use what the competitors use.

That's the same thing as choosing an ordered list in a voting. If I can't get this guy, give
me this guy; if I can't get that guy, give me that guy; and if I can't take this other one,
okay then I'll take that one. Just like an improved voting system that gets more data
from the voter whose will you're trying to execute in the world with telling you about
how the education should look. I don't take the raw binary position that you shouldn't
teach the thing, I say you shouldn't teach the thing but if there's an exception, or if
you don't completely agree with me then my fallback position is this.

Anytime you're giving someone advice it might be useful to adopt a menu of
preferable fallback positions than throw the all-or-nothing "hail Mary passed down
the field" and hope that they fall upon your most extreme position, or what might
appear to them to be your most extreme position, even though it may not be extreme
at all or even harsher than your other suggestions. Or is this considered framing?

When you're arguing against other paths of belief or activity, it's not that they don't
work. It's not that it can't be argued against, or shouldn't be argued against or should
never be done, it's just that they have a higher likelihood of leading to outcomes that
are bad. They won't always, but they're statistically more likely to. The improvements
that you suggest are not perfect, they are just better.

You can influence people that don't know you exist, you can also have multiple identities
too

Be a lighthouse before a spotlight. Be a beacon of greatness before an identifier of the
suck. Try to focus all positive and leave out much of the negative if at all possible. The
amount of time you can spend disproving the idiots and stupidity is vastly larger than
just promoting the right stuff, and if you disprove the bad stuff, you only leave a hole
that they will fill with different bad stuff. It's much better to just push the smart good
stuff up front. This is perhaps why it's not that useful to go and disprove all the things
one by one.

The value of making new "classics"

If you look at the distribution of books on syllabuses, you will see that "the Republic"
is still number 2. most required reading across all college syllabuses. If not number
one, (need to check the Hacker News thread
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10956097

http://www.nvtimes.com/2016/01/24/opinion/sundav/what-a-million-syllabuses-can-

teach-us.htmL .)

Isn't it rather odd that the most prescribed books are the oldest? Shouldn't we have
new progressive benchmarks? I.e. hasn't anyone made better books covering the
same material? http://explorer.opensyllabusproiect.org/

You shouldn't care. You have to earn being around long enough to meet those challenges.
Futurists, and transhumanists are largely guilty of focusing on problems that will never be
theirs.

Stay in the game. Remain relevant.

Autobiographers often have time to be as such, because they stopped being important

Biographies are when you write about what it was like back when you used to matter,
using all the free time you have, because you don't matter anymore. Maybe they're
really all ghost written and thus don't actually take much time out of their days.

SORT

Let the sound of your fingers on keys be your music.

Don't be a degenerate gambler with your time.

So many of us look down on those with crippling addictions. A man who just can't stop
losing money gambling, taking the same bad deals over and over again. Well, don't feel too
superior. As that man gambles with money, it's like you do with your time. Doing the same
things over and over again that never pay off, yet you just can't stop doing them. It's easy to
see that man's bank account is empty, it's not as easy to see how you've wasted away so
much of your precious time.

Urgent isn't important

What can you do that has lasting value?

How can you setup the game to win?

What can you do to reward and punish yourself so that your life has the emotions you
want, and the destiny you desire?

If you don't setup the game in a way you can win, you will never win.

Know your outcome, and know it very specificly. If you don't know exactly what you want,
you may never notice that you've already achived it, and thus steal from yourself the glory
and good feelings you deserve. Realize when you've won the game and celebrate!

Climbing the stairs of desire

The stair climbing strategy of want, get, be satisfied, want different, get, be satisfied over
and over is the most effective that exists. You're not supposed to be in any one of those 3
states too long, you're supposed to cycle through them. As a living person it's not normal or
desireable to be totally still, neither in emotion or location. To be human is to experience
not just the storms and calms of mother nature, but of our own passions.

What got you here won't get you there. You need to change behaviors if you want to take it
to the next level.

Directional tactics/Scope

You eat cheeseburgers in a single direction, you don't' eat a circle around the outside, or at
least you shouldn't. Thus, when you are working, feel free to get started, and just iterate
and go a single direction. Don't worry about understanding everything up front, you'll
understand it better once you've started.

If there is work that has to be done no matter what, go ahead and do it, instead of sitting in
analysis paralysis. Do that which others only dream.

Discipline beats motivation

Having tunnel vision is faster than removing distractions.

Tunnel vision is discipline, changing your environment is "motivation"

Another artifact you'll see of people trying to break through the barriers to getting hard
work done, is they'll try to minimize all the distractions. Sure, you could do that, but you are
kind of falling for the meta of controlling what isn't the work. If you saved the time you
would have spent doing that, and just forced the discipline of doing the suck, then you
would win 2x. lx from actually doing the work, and lx from not wasting time "minimizing
distractions." You'll find that if you maximize whatever screen you are working on, its
already done all the distraction minimization for you! All you see is that window. Maximize
and go!

Computing

Combine what you need to do, with what you want to do

If you want an excuse to write your book, perhaps try out that new keyboard you've bought,
or a new key layout, or new hotkeys, perhaps a custom programmed keyboard layer. The
trick here, is that, if you get used to testing your news setup while you are doing something
productive, you will get progress in both the productive thing, in this case book writing, and
in the other, experiment for fun thing.

You can see this example other places like, trying your new headphones out on a jog, or
testing your new running shoes, running.

Now, where is the pitfall here? Well, if you get used to testing the new cool things in the
wrong, useless place, you will get more addicted to doing the wrong thing, and it will such
away the time you would have had to do those things that you know you really should be
doing.

Picking some cool or fun things around what it is that you know you should be doing is
great, if and only if you can make sure you use and have fun with the cool things only when
you're doing the productive thing that you're trying to make more fun, to make a habit.
Don't spend 100 hours doing typing tests of random words fed to you. Do spend 100 hours
expressing yourself using your own words. Only one of the two has lasting value.

Combined learning

If you're lucky, the two things you're playing with might even amplify each other. For
instance, if you wanted to practice your singing, and you wanted to learn a new language,
great! Now you can practice singing a song in a new language!

Paying attention isn't free. Caring is a finite resource.

You only have so much attention, be careful what hobbies you have and how many, for at
some point they control you more than you control them.

Mental tricks to stay engaged



When you feel like you must stop, you just program your brain to think, great, that's the
trigger for me to continue! Like an infinite loop. It will stop on its own eventually, no
reason to help it fail early by not using it. If I can't, I must.

Universally good advice

Gym and delete Facebook, good for all times
Great analysis of what a piece of shit facebook is
http://www.salimvirani.eom//facebook/

If you're a good measurer, whatever you measure, it's true. It's easier to get truth out of the
real world, measuring-wise. Some other truths are much harder to come to when you have
to do more than measure, like predict or see something without measuring shit like that.

There are a lot of times when the worst person to measure whether you are performing
well, acting well, or have good posture, saying the right words, or lifting a weight the right
way is you, because you're busy doing the thing and being reactionary, responding to your
subconscious impetus to do the thing. On the contrary, the people around you, they have
more processing power to observe what you are doing with your body, which you're not
focused on, what you're doing with your voice, what you're focusing on that is to the
exclusion of other things. It's actually possible that someone else could see you doing
something before you're aware of the concept that you're doing it.

It doesn't just apply to martial arts or lifting weights, it applies to facial expression. If
someone else looks at you and can tell you don't like a thing, you may not realize that you
do not like the thing, because it's outside your focus. You're focused on the thing and he's
focused on you. You could respond to people's internal state quicker than they can, and be
aware of it quicker than they can, because they're busy doing it and your busy watching it.
There's a trick where if someone's going to slight you, you can preemptively slight them, or
perform an activity which punishes their bad behavior, but do it so quickly that you don't
seem petty, or slight, it just seems like the natural course of events.

Your personal attributes compound against each other so if you've got a really strong
position in one area, you're already in diminishing returns on it. You should work on the
other areas that would multiply against it. So if you've only got three traits, let's say they're
looks, money and leads, then you'd work the ones you don't already have.

When people say that you should dress to impress and dress for a job, it's not the dressing
that matters. It's other people's perception of your usefulness. So, dressing is one part of
that. Posture is one part of that. Knowledge is a part of that. Focus, are you self-centered?
Do you care about them? Do you work well in teams? It's not just dress for success, it's be
useful.

Fuck dressing for success, like dress for usefulness. Success looks different in different
environments. You wouldn't want to wear a business suit scuba diving, I would assume. If
you want to save money, you should be taking your extra downtime and using it to research
getting a lower cost and buying larger quantities on places like eBay and
, because it is unlikely that you'll find a better deal on almost anything than those places.

If you must try drugs, try to do it after you do all the other cool, bad ass shit. And if you must
try drugs, realize they are dangerous as fuck. Get the testing kits, do a lot of research, be



very careful. Don't take anyone's word for anything. Have all the safeties in place. Don't be
driving. Plan for it to go bad, plan for your heart to stop. Why not? You only have one heart.
So, you know, do your research. Plan it. Do it right, or be someone that's happy living this
life where you only get to feel what you earn to feel through directed focus. Maybe it’s
meditation, maybe it's yoga, maybe it's deprivation tanks, maybe it's just having a really
positive outlook. You can feel all the great feelings of life without needing to do the
superhuman shit.

If you're ever curious why you shouldn't sacrifice all of your time and life energy for a giant
mega corporation, think about dividing up what you are across all the people of the world.
Give everyone a penny. How much money do you have? Or more interestingly, everyone
needs to eat, so you give a little piece of your body to everybody and see how many people
you can feed. What you discover is that if you want to live properly in this world, you need
to be a little greedy.

Remember to mention the iteration that women are very unhappy building problems,
thinking about things and associating with them and making great narratives about
whatever problem that they have going on. When they bring that thing to you and show it
to you, they don't want you to destroy it with your simple, logical, easy, solution because
that's to disrespect all the work they put into understanding such a fine and beautiful
problem that they're very, very, very desperately trying to convince you is insolvable and
therefore gigantic. They want to take small problems and make them large, and if you take a
large problem and make it small, you're an asshole. You just fucked up a lot of work they
did. You just made it less important, and they spent all day making it more important.

Really, really, really make sure that it's one of the 1 out of 50 times that your girl actually
wants you to solve something before you fuck them over and destroy the excellent problem
that they helped create.

If you're not using a paper and pen and taking advantage of the fact that the worst paper
and pen is better than the best memory, you're doing harm to yourself and your friends and
your loved ones. You're making their subconscious work against them.

Don't discount the power of repetition. In addition, don't discount, in a lot of areas, the
necessity of repetition. In other areas, still, you might not have to pull your punches. Your
hardest punch might not be enough.

No one else has the privilege of seeing how you can destroy people by being overly nice,
because you have had to have worked hard enough and saved hard enough to be able to be
overly nice to another person. You don't get to see the destructive effects unless you've
experimented in the world of doing something most people can't, which is providing
financially too much for another person.

People that don't have prenuptial agreements, they get divorces. The reason is if you give
someone a million dollar reward for thinking you're not funny or cool to hang out with
anymore, let me tell you, for a million dollars it's very easy for people to fall out of love with
you. For a million dollars, it's very easy for people to think that you're just not that cool
anymore. You could be the funniest guy in the world and if there's a million dollars payoff
for not laughing at your jokes, that million dollars is going to get paid. Don't structure the



underlying agreements and mutual beliefs in a way where the parties have a reason to
break it.


You hear these stories about terrible things happening to people and no one ever even calls
911 because they felt someone else was going to do it. You learn the way to overcome that
is to look at a single person and point directly at them and say, "You. You call 911 now. You."
And make sure that they understand. It's funny when you learn these tricks, like if you're
getting raped don't yell rape, yell fire because people are more likely to come.

People need to learn the contraindications for their suggestions, particularly the medicals
ones, because they're very small set. In the unlikely chance that anyone accepts the advice
it'll prevent great harm from the people accepting it.

It's important to know that there are some principles which apply all over the place, which
are the great awesome things, that's like learning how to duck a punch. You don't have to
be a really smart guy to duck a punch, you just have to practice. You don't have to be a
really smart guy to throw a punch, you just have to practice it. What I was teaching earlier
about things that can be taught and things that can't be taught, this is one of the bad ass
things that will make you smarter, make you more powerful, make you more effective that
can be taught, so let's learn it.

Timing, timing exists. If you go to get your eyes checked, it's best to go with your eyes
already tired, already under strain, because those are the times when you will need your
glasses the most. Therefore, it's better to go there with your eyes under that condition
when you do the testing, so that the prescription that you get is there when you need it the
most. Now, would a normal person know that there was a better and worse time to get
their eye test? No, it's not easy to know. Would a person know that when you get your
prescription made that there's actually a level of tolerance at the lab that makes your
glasses, and some labs have higher tolerance than others.

For instance, if you have a stigmatism that needs to be corrected by a certain number of
degrees, then some labs are okay with five degrees, some are okay with two, some are okay
with seven and the person writing the prescription is actually able to write on the
prescription that no tolerances are allowed. You wouldn't know that shit. You would just
assume that when these glasses came out of the glass factory that they were properly
created. These types of assumptions about timing and quality exist all over the place and
people are just starting to become aware of them.

People thought that what you ate was super important and then they realize that there's
micro of amazing bacteria in people's guts and that they're mildly different. What might be
a great diet for you isn't for someone else, not only because they're biologically different,
but because of this other species of shit that has nothing to do with their DNA, they have
their own DNA. All the bacteria and little things that live in your stomach operate
differently. What lives in your stomach is so important that koalas actually eat their mom's
shit, it's called Pap; in order to colonize their guts with the bacteria that they need to digest
what is primarily their food source almost exclusively their primary source, their nutrient
source which is...?

Put your food in the fridge oldest to the front, nearest to the rear, so that when you use
them in the order it makes some sense. Same with your clothes, when you're done washing
your clothes, put your clean clothes on the very back so that you use the ones that haven't
been used yet. Otherwise you short cycle and the small group that is in the front gets used
and then washed and will just keep getting cycled and cycled quicker. Then they'll fade or
get too small and you won't be able to use them anymore. It's better to cycle everything
even.

Shortcuts to organizing things in your house is to use the same organization system from the
store that you bought it from, because they already put the effort in putting things in the
categories. You need the category when you bought it so you can use the same
categorization in your home to find it.

Travel checklists are pretty useful.

If you're looking for an obviously easy way to improve your life, take a look at through your
Internet search history, see if there’s any particular type of pretty people that you look at
more than others on the Internet. Maybe they're naked, maybe they're in bikinis, maybe
they're just smiling, and move to wherever those people come from, wherever they're most
numerous. Then you'll be naturally triggered to be happier and hell, I can't see how getting
it the natural way is any worse than paying for a bill for brainwashing yourself.

Goal setting

Specificity

If you aren't specific about what you want, then you're not able to make those
decisions where they can be made.

If you get an A in the class that you don't care about, then you're going to see your
worst on the things you did care about, but didn't have time for.

Intermittent and faster rewards enhance task engagement

The people that have, through dedicated habit, luck or curiosity, or chemical
intervention that can stay engaged with a task for longer, they're able to reap the
profit of having skill that takes many hours to develop, remember and execute.

I think it would be useful for people to see personal development as rewarding in the
short term to enhance repetitive and short term rewarding, so that people don't have
to bridge these vacuous gaps of suck and friction. It is better that they stay in the
rolling friction of constant, intermittent rewards would, but I guess shorter, smaller
term ones would be a close second. Thus, if you know that when you go to the gym
you are actually getting laid, and that's what triggers in your brain, or if you know that
when you are working hard, making money, you are actually getting laid, then that's
just one more reason to do the right thing, and overcome the easy wrong thing that's
always there nagging you to choose it to your own detriment.

Maybe someone should solve the reward problem. Maybe if you gamified book
writing and have like a voting system and a peer group that rewards you for work well
done, and then you pay into the system by reviewing other people's shit the same way



they're reviewing yours, maybe you'd have a self-reinforcing cluster fuck of people
circle jerking each other into greatness. Isn't that what teams are? Isn't that what
clubs are? Pretty sure that's what they are. Pretty sure there's people circle jerking
each other to get excellence and performance out of their life.

Time

Make all your watches accurate to NIST time. Why not?

Use alarms, now you don't have to be worried about missing a thing, let your phone worry
for you.

Use calendars with alarms, now you don't have to miss people's birthdays or forget to get
your teeth cleaned.

Cheating



Mr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson. If an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you
wouldn't be adverse to taking it, would you?

Homer: Uhh, not as such.

Mr. Burns: Neither would I. I've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days
about so-called cheating. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty
as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the
quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them?
Well, I say cheating is the gift man gives himself!

Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat.

Mr. Burns: Excellent.

Get off your ass and do something. Stop learning. All of these chapters of awesomeness mean
nothing if left unacted upon.

The world doesn't need to learn more. The knowledge is all free; free to deliver, free to
receive, free to get. It's never been better, it's never been more plentiful. We don't need
more knowledge, we need people to get off their ass and do things, and that's what sales
people do, more so than anyone else in the world. They get you to sign on the dotted line
and to use your economic resources to better your own life, and then now you got to do
something for somebody else.

General success, gratitude, relationships, peer group, internal environment, fairness to one’s self













The pain of working goes away when you start the work. Getting to the gym is hard, being at
the gym is easy. You can't live at the gym forever, or at work forever, that's great, you don't
need to, and you shouldn't, you sure as hell can have a healthy duty cycle though.

How americans spend their day

http://www.datavisualisations.net/2016/12/31/how-americans-spend-their-day/



Avoid everything you "kinda" want to do.

The avoid at all cost idea that if you list your top 25 things you want to do, you pick 5 and
avoid at all cost the other 20, because they'll make it more likely you don't achieve the top
5. I don't agree with this, because the 6th could actually be on the path of 1-5, however the
idea that you only have space for a couple hobbies, and really only have enough time to
personally fuck with a couple things professionally, means, that like another quote
attributed to warren buffet,

"The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful
people say no to almost everything."

The negative space of getting thing done

If you picked your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they
might hurt the top 5, you would be using the negative space idea. The result is more work
on the shit you really care about. Depending on how far different your 1-25 really were, you
might have a top 10 that were almost all the same thing, so there's a little bit of accuracy of
scope that is involved. XX I should rephrase this idea with the right instructions to not have
too much overlap

You know how there's a momentum thing to working out, like once you get the ball rolling
towards going to the gym, once you're there it's very easy to just work out, well the same




thing applies to fucking off, if you get the fucking off, or missing a workout, or eating shitty
food, then it's really easy to keep that ball rolling as well.

Thus as important as it is to show that you should get the ball rolling in the right direction,
it's almost as important to make sure that you don't get the ball rolling in the wrong
direction.

How to use this: Start your day with what is first on your list and work your way down.

Avoid at all costs the time sinks and general fuckaroundery that have stolen the most hours
of your life. Those fucking hours aren't coming back.

Steve martin also quotes the ascetic style of focusing on only one thing! Fuck all the other
shiny distractions so other comics got taken away with
Making fulfilment fun

If you want an excuse to write your book, perhaps try out that new keyboard you've bought,
or a new key layout, or new hotkeys, perhaps a custom programmed keyboard layer. The
trick here, is that, if you get used to testing your news setup while you are doing something
productive, you will get progress in both the productive thing, in this case book writing, and
in the other, experiment for fun thing.

You can see this example other places like, trying your new headphones out on a jog, or
testing your new running shoes, running.

Now, where is the pitfall here? Well, if you get used to testing the new cool things in the
wrong, useless place, you will get more addicted to doing the wrong thing, and it will such
away the time you would have had to do those things that you know you really should be
doing.

TLDR Enjoyment

Picking some cool or fun things around what it is that you know you should be doing is
great, if and only if you can make sure you use and have fun with the cool things only
when you're doing the productive thing that you're trying to make more fun, to make
a habit. Don't spend 100 hours doing typing tests of random words fed to you. Do
spend 100 hours expressing yourself using your own words. Only one of the two has
lasting value.

Save time with Combined learning

If you're lucky, the two things your playing with might even amplify each other. For
instance, if you wanted to practice your singing, and you wanted to learn a new
language, great! Now you can practice singing a song in a new language!

Getting shit done

You don't need to manage what song is playing, or send a friend a link to something cool
you found, or leave a comment, when you're not busying being your own DJ. Let your mind
fill your life with the music of your own dreams.

Measure and remeasure your habits, for you'll likely find they don't pay what they used to
Significance pump

You can skip motivational stuff by just getting your significance from the hard shit you're
doing. The reason it's easier to argue with people on the internet than it is to write a book,
is because you get a feeling of winning nearly instantly when you crush idiots on the



internet, but you don't really get any positive significance feedback in a reasonable time
frame on text that you write for a book.

Thus when you want to get things done, you can either work building motivation, or you can
work doing the actual hard things that you'd hoped that the motivation would get you to
want to do. You make it easier to do the hard stuff when you create a short term reward
where your psyche feels good doing the hard stuff, because you feel important having done
it. If you can manage this without involving third parties, even better.

Focus (focus is in time because it's how you divide your minutes)

Distractions eat time and crap problems,

Most books are written by people in their 30s, because if you're 20, you're too stupid
to know anything to write about. If you're 40, you don't give a shit to write about it
anymore. If you only have a couple of good ideas, it's a lot easier to get started and
feel good about what your'e doing than if you have tons of good ideas. Knowing too
much, or being too old, or being too smart, can all get in the way of being productive.
Any of those things makes it harder for you to focus on a single thing till completion,
because theres more and more side interests and things that get in the way, like a
house, or a family, or your hobbies, or your yacht.

Women save time, no HAIR extensions

There is no better way to start your day than by growing your strength and willpower. The
feeling of accomplishment makes all the tasks of the day so much easier.


Intro

• Break through the bullshit

• Let's be serious. If reading a book on how to get rich actually worked for people, well by
golly, you'd know a lot more rich people. Knowledge is only as useful as it's
application.

The first step to getting things done, is actually wanting things. When you want things badly
enough, that you must have them, then you might schedule them. If you schedule things,
you might do them. If you do them, you might get what you thought you would get, and
thus get what you wanted.

The first step to scheduling is the desire. The why. Then the urgency. Why must you have it
now? If you solve the why, everything will pretty much work on autopilot. It's just like
habits. You only have to work to build a habit about 3 weeks, until it sticks, then its
autopilot, you just do it without thinking, its free and awesome once you're 3 weeks in. If
you want something urgently enough, you'll find a way.

Don't watch, do! Life isn't a spectator sport, get in the game.

"You can't call failing to do the important thing multitasking" - Richard on June 2nd, 2016
Start the day a winner

Wake up 7am, bathroom/weigh yourself, walk to your home gym, Chin-ups, Bench, Deadlift,
overhead press, breakfast,, shower, floss, brush teeth, scrape tongue. Now do the thing
you're most likely to put off, first. Just as you exercised your body, you shall exercise your



will power. What are the strengths of this schedule? Put up slighter better reps on chin-ups
because you're 1 breakfast and 1 bathroom trip lighter. Alternated pushing and pulling
movements. Ordered the exercises by muscle groups external attractiveness. Showered
after working out while combing teeth maintenance, shaving, haircare, deodorant, perfume.

Hard tasks to will power are like heavy weights to muscles.

Will power gets stronger with training, just like your muscles. I wouldn't be surprised if
willpower could be grown differently like muscles can be grown differently as well. There
might be something akin to fast-twitch and slow-twitch will power. Just like you should
exercise your body every day, you should exercise your will every day as well.

Drive, the feeling that makes you do.

Upgrade your "shoulds" to "musts."

The more things you upgrade from "shoulds" to "musts" the more you'll actually
schedule, and then do, and then get.

Get a coach or a partner or a team

You'll do more to maintain your positive relationship with them than you will for
yourself.

God damn sports spectating

The mascot changes, the name changes, the city changes, the players change, the coach
changes, what the fuck are you rooting for exactly? No one throws you the ball and no one
runs your plays, go do fucking anything else for the love of all that is good!

Stats

What on earth could be more useless than not only watching the games, but
memorizing the stats. Who in the fuck cares how many individual lumps of crap
you've passed through your toilet bowl, similar to how many balls have gone through
metal rings or uprights, it don't fucking matter. Actually the turdlings number might
be more fun, at least you could change your diet to screw around with it.

Tactics

Free up your time by not wasting it (Don't do wrong things)

Intro

Waste not a minute for minutes are what life is made of

Time is the great equalizer of men. We all have only 24 hours in a day.

Use this to outcompete everyone else. While they're watching the game
on tv, you can be catching the winning pass and making love to the
homecoming queen/king.

Most people waste tons of time every day

Since you're reading this book, you might not be "most" people, compare
yourself to the average American:

Replace time wasting with time honoring

Take everything you do that upon analysis doesn't actually lead to any
tangible benefits to your life, and just replace them, and do it for 3 weeks
so it sticks.

If you cut out browsing Facebook, or really idly browsing anything you
choose, what could you use that time for? Learning a new language?
Finding love? Creating something beautiful?


The sky isn't the limit! You can built a weather balloon and send a
miniature camera into space, past our sky. Use GPS to find it when it
comes back down and view the photos of earth from the stratosphere.


O Bryan Chan. Youtube


Use your jealousy!

Jealousy exists to motivate you to act in the right directions! If you
don't have juicy things you want at first look, then notice what







you're jealous of, and getting those things. If you are still having
trouble finding something juicy to replace your time sinks with, then
just pick something other people enjoy, and try it for a few weeks to
see if you'd learn to enjoy it to. Anything is better than the same
dead ends you're already an expert at.

Specifics

Identify the waste

Are you really good at the wrong things? That's worse not better. Makes
you like the wrong things more than you should. If you have a lot of
"achievement badges" in a video game, you could say that’s a counter
achievement anywhere outside that game.

Pooping

Eat less

Drink less alcohol, take less pain killers
Squatty potty

Combine your pooping with other tasks you already would be doing in
near the toilet

Drop a piece of toilet paper in the bowl first so you don't splash your butt
with water

Pee sitting down if standing up is making a mess
Learning things you don't use
Honor your time Highest and best (do right things)

Be efficient Do the right things the right way
Don't fix what isn't broken (time sinks)

Respect how hard things really are (complexity)

Before you think of changing the motor in your car, how often do other
people do that? Want to be the first person on the block to have or do
XYZ experimental new thing? Be prepared to see it blow up in your face,
perhaps literally. I tried silencing my coffee machine with Dynamat, didn't
work. I tried sanding my keycaps with a Dremel to make them smoother,
boy did they surface melt fast. If you want greatness you have to
experiment, just respect complexity while you do. The more complicated
your idea, the more and more likely it will not only never happen, but fuck
you up the whole way.

Use proven solutions, don't experiment

Being on the cutting edge, makes you bleed. First adopters are how you
discover what needs fixed. Whenever you can, massively favor as many
already known to work together parts in your master plan as you can,
because when you do hit a problem, and you surely will, you are
absolutely going to love all the free tech support and innovative solutions
that all the poor bastards that were there first had to discover and create,
and luckily tell the world about. Ask anyone that has been modifying a
"project car" of theirs for years and years, the progress is slow as hell and
often seems to be going backwards. The car seems to get more
disassembled instead of assembled. That looks like, and often is, the
opposite of progress. If you're looking for a competitive advantage, or
want to do something never before done though, you might just have to
bite the experiment bullet.



Choosing what to do (pathing)

Copying what works

Modelling great behavior that gets great results

Many of the concepts I've developed regarding influence were just by looking at the
patterns I unknowingly was using to generate influence successfully, like giving
positive and negative reasons to do a thing, to help the person feel it. Maybe they
respond better to fear, maybe greed, maybe they just like more reasons to do a thing.
It's by analyzing what worked that I came up with a name for it, and now that you can
see the framework, you can translate it into different behaviors. Negative space is
used in art, lets notice where it's used in influence as well.

Focus

Distractions: Tunnel vision is your friend

Add distraction: You might work better with a little distraction
Play media

If you work better with music or movies playing in the background (which some
people do, because it may quell the desire to switch tasks, or it may dull some of
their conscious to leave some other parts of the brain to be more effective. This
is actually done with transcranial magnetic stimulation as well. If you stop some
of the interfering things that are going on in the brain, it will amplify your ability
to do some other things. For instance if I'm speed typing, I can sometimes get
speed boost by tightening unrelated muscles and it feels to me like a more
mental than physical change in performance (xx weak example)

Music can change the way you feel. If what you feel affects how you perform,
then it's an obvious that for some, listening to music can enhance performance.
Lots of people that jog have some playlists just for that activity.

Find good media

Thus, if you're one that enjoys music, you'll find that most of the best
music has a YouTube video to go with it. And some of the 2nd tier music,
assuming you have tastes similar to other YouTube users, has non
directed, weaker videos, usually of a spectrum analyzer jumping around,
or some other non specific filler content.

Play the media properly

Thus, the tips are 1. Click next faster on songs that don't have real videos
directed specificly for them, because they're less likely to be good, if you
have common tastes. 2. Keep the YouTube window minimized so the
cool and well done video doesn't distract you from your work and use
hotkeys to click next or pause when needed. Unless you can ignore the
video and still benefit from it being there. That is entirely dependent on
how accurate your opinion is of whether you work better under silence, or
audio only, or audio and video together. If there's a difference at all. XX(
this should be made into an app, it gives you the benefits of time dilation
((if you're male) (from red color)) and it gives you the subconscious focus
and drive and competitiveness that comes from seeing a mate you
desperately want (xx thesaurus desperately)



If you work to make a nice playlist, save it, then you don't' have to do the
work again, or you can just use other people's playlists, to save time, or
dicover new media.

Execution

Execute and share your ideas

Doing your ideas instead of writing about them
Put first things first

Whatever you put second sometimes never happens.

Do things in the right order

If you're making a cake, you need to mix the batter before you try to bake the cake. If you
don't... Tony thinks you should coin the term of doing the amplifying shit first, perhaps using
the order of operations moniker.

Productivity

Become a productivity god.

Find an edge

Find an edge somewhere - working on a weekend night can be the difference between
those who win and those who work for those who win.

Complete over time, one by one

Collecting things and following through on a task and getting a minimum viable product and
getting your essential fatty acids and doing a little bit of everything to get a complete useful
thing instead of overdoing one place, and then running out of money or steam before you
can get any type of business done and signaling cleaning up your nest. Showing people that
you have the ability to both organize and acquire things from the outside world and
manipulate them into the way that you like is a reason that collecting things exist it's
signaling to others that you can manipulate the world around you. And find things that
other people can't find and maintain them in addition to all the other defective parts.

R744

Persistence

Do what you're supposed to

There's all kinds of ways that you can enhance the likelihood that you actually do what
you're supposed to do.

Non-violent crime, patience

I'm pretty the fuck enraged with every new violent crime that I fucking read about that is
the result of some backwards fucking cancerous culture. Fuck cancer culture. Tolerance is
weakness disguised as virtue, similar to patience.

Now let's say that properly and reasonably applied tolerance and patience is surely virtuous
however it comes, not in name, but in application. If you are patient about breathing, you
may surely die. If you are tolerant of ingesting poisons, you may surely also die, tolerance
and patience have their place, and you must harshly have adjudicated where and when they
may be employed, and when they need be banished.

Being creative, momentum

Being creative is a lot like pull-ups, it's quite easy to do it, once you are doing it, it does take
concentration and effort, and your body trying to tell you to stop, and being creative and
productive is quite the same. I think creativity is a muscle and the more often you use it, and
try using it at different speeds and in different ways, the stronger that muscle gets.

Break the anti-lock brakes of life
Anti-lock brakes



Anti-locked brakes work by making sure your tires never get into sliding friction and
they stay in starting friction. Because sliding friction is really low and starting friction is
really high. Life has the brakes on you. Life is making sure that you don't kick ass and
slide forward through life and go really fast through life and get a lot of shit done. By
making everything just hard enough. That you can't break into the zone. Break into
the sliding friction. It just makes everything just hard enough. It's just hard enough to
get a phone number. It's just hard enough to get a credit card. It's just hard enough to
get a storefront. It's just hard enough to do these things. But if you're able to break
through the anti-lock brakes of life, if you're able to break through the difficulties.

Then you just slide right on through, right. That that's the reason that it's very easy to
keep doing something that you've done for a couple weeks. It's very, very hard to start
that is the anti-lock brakes of life.

R751

Torque curve

All right, it's analogy time. You spend your time going out and getting drunk and using what
you've got, doing sales instead of product development and research and development
moving yourself up the attractiveness food chain. In an ideal world, the top 10% of guys get
the top 10% of girls, and then on down the way, then you have variants for people that got
lucky or are willing to work harder, hooked up with people with weird brain mutations.
You've got this analogy between business, product development, pricing, framing, then like
brute cold-calling sales. Those things are kind of opposites, you have to choose, you're going
to do one or the other.

That's how it works; employees cost money, employees take time, you have finite time, you
have finite money, you either choose to do one or the other. Step 2, just like a car, when
you build an engine, if you have a really big engine it's going to put lots of torque, it's going
to be hard to use, because it's going to spin the tires and that's going to have a lower RPM
max because it's heavier and then you know it's so a smaller turbo engine can shit in it on
the top end but not as much on the low end because of the leg right.

What if you turbo the giant motor right well now you can do things that the little motor
could never do. Because the little motor's at the top of its game. It's like buying an M3 from
BMW, can't do shit to it before they had turbos when they're naturally aspirated you
couldn't do anything to it was already maxed out. You know you can spend a couple
thousand dollars and get a couple horsepower but if you get an M3 with a turbo now you
know you change the software map in a chip and it just boosts more at more rpm ranges
and yeah now you're just shitting out power for nearly free.

In life there's these choosing the shape of your torque curve choosing the shape of your
horse power curve and you know getting more area under the curve is better than getting a
giant peak saying that's how much power your motor puts out but only does it for a second,
right - before red line or it only does it for a second before it overheats. That same type of
distribution of energy and getting more area under the curve kind of applies to you know
other areas of human endeavor, such as being fit or being wealthy or being happy or finding
love in your life. I would say that you know I would rather have fewer fucking amazing
experiences than more mediocre experiences.



That's a choice I would make. Maybe there's other people out there that would make a
different choice. It's hard to say which one of those choices is better. I'm kind of biased
towards thinking of mine's better. But since I haven't put a shit a lot of time into it, you
know I can't speak with great confidence that I wouldn't change my mind for some people
somewhere that you know a different path might be better for them.

environment, over a long time leads to massive velocity.

Disproving the stupid, asymmetric warfare

There are easy and hard things to do in this world. Multiplication is easy, division is hard.

Just as it's very easy to create new ideas that have no basis in reality. We call it fiction. It's
the most popular content on the planet. Fiction is easy to create. Sadly, as fiction is
multiplication, disproving fiction is division. Division is how you undo multiplication, and
truth finding is how you undo fiction, unfortunately is a losing battle, for every 1 hour of
fiction creation requires 10 or 100 hours of disproving. For this reason I must speak as much
as possible direct truth, rather than the truth dirtied by touching the ever expanding fictions
of the world.

Stagnation of great people

It sucks that great minds like Aubrey de grey, Ray Kurzweil, and nearly all other speakers
including Tony Robbins seem to get to a level and just stay there, their talks don’t change,
they say the same crap for years, it doesn't' evolved, and you can't really enjoy watching it
again once you can sell what they 're selling as well as they can. Why is there this
stagnation? Why doesn't the same bad ass interesting thought processes, focuses, and
processing power lead them to a refinement and development of what is worth listening
them speak about? Have they nothing more interesting to say? Perhaps that's one of the
advantages fiction has, you're really not likely to be writing and selling the same book again
and again over the years. You're really expected to be novel and new.

If you take a guy like the waitbutwhy.com guy, he never has the same shit to say, because
he's more focused on spreading newly discovered ideas and information he's researched
than he is saying yesterday's interesting things over and over again.

Golf

Life is like golf, you don't need to hit a hole-in-one, just get a little closer every time.

Setting the bar low

"Reaching new heights of setting the bar low"

Excellence over time

Why do artists and directors start to suck harder over time? Is it because they're returned to
the state they existed in before they were awesome? Which was non awesome. Or is it a
different form of failure, is it that they stop searching, stopped experimenting, stopped






paying homage to other great things. If you think you're the smartest guy you know, or the
smartest guy around, I guess there's no reason trying to learn from other people right?
Don't make the same mistake these guys did resting on their laurels. Whatever you did that
caused you to transition from being the suck, to being good, you should probably keep
doing that. If you change horses midstream, particularly to a shittier horse that's nothing
like the original horse, you're probably fucking up. I think what you'll see in many great
companies and artists, hell even cars, is a gradual refinement and progression, more so that
just giving up entirely on the old things, and just doing the new thing.

It could also be the case that whatever mistakes and missteps that truly great artists and
companies need to watch out for, are nowhere similar to what you need to watch for. If
you've never achieved greatness, you don't' need to worry about losing it. This is more of
the opportunity cost of changing stuff. If you already type 100 wpm, and you change to
another keyboard or system, you could lose 50 wpm. If you suck at typing, and only do
20wpm, well, if you cut your performance in half, you only lose 10 wpm. Thus it costs more
of the successful to experiment. It costs more for the wealthy when they make mistakes. If
you look at this in flat dollar cost. An already great artist has lots to lose if he switches from
the rare state of excellence into the experimental state that was similar to non-excellence

If you're not perfect, keep getting better

Perfection is rare, thus progress should be common. If your model of the world hasn't
changed in 20 years, then you are not making progress. What's more likely, that your model
is perfect, or you've stopped caring.

Balance

Amplified Activity / rest states (crash and burn for profit)

CPU's and many creatures have periods of activity and periods of rest, and the cyclical
nature provides them superior results and efficiency than a more constant lower volatility
state would. It's why animals pounce. It's why boxers cock their fists back before releasing
them forward. And if it works at that level, it's very likely that one level extra on top of it, by
having stimulants push you harder, and then crashing to lower, is likely an effective way to
compound what the normal activity / rest states are doing for you.

You can see other examples of this such as "work sprints." HIIT training. Hell, even chewing
and eating works this way.

Tasks

The way the Pomodoro system works is by forcing you to take a break, so you feel greedy
about getting the most of what seems limited, and in that system you're always limited! It's
using time limits to create scarcity and rarity, and your subconscious responds to that by
wanting to do what it's doing harder as long as you can because you'll run out of time soon.
It's a way to use scheduled fucking off to make the time you have to do work limited, and
therefore increase your conscious and subconscious desire to do that thing that you know
you need to do. It also reduces the perceived cost you have to starting working on a thing
because it makes the amount of time you can put into the think more limited, which makes
the thing seem like a smaller investment and therefore reduces starting friction.




This strategy of time gating is one of a few ways you can kick more ass on tasks. There's
other like, the dickens process where you focus on what the real cost to your life will be if
you continue to engage in disempowering behaviors, and you can amplify the negative
feelings associated with doing the wrong stuff and the great feelings from doing the right
stuff.

A lack of balance

A lack of balance is the definition of pain. On the cellular level. If you want to unlock a door,
you need the key to move the tumblers to allow the cylinder to turn, only the correct
balance of height of each tumbler will allow to work, and you find that same kind of
required balance solution to everything else in the world as well. For you to be able to
classify the thing as a thing, for instance an open lock, it needed to be lined up the right way
first.

If you didn't have the lock balanced, and able to unlock you wouldn't be able to classify it as
an unlocked door, I mention it because it exists with all matter, if there are too many atoms
of one kind instead of another, you have a whole another material, for instance you would
no longer have water, you would have hydrogen and oxygen, and even amongst those
atoms, if you move some electrons around, you no longer have the same atom any more. I
mean at some point, I guess the value of seeing that everything contains balance, is a little
tautological because by definition if it wasn't' in balance, it would cease to be that thing, and
it would instead be a different thing.

Maybe the world would be better off if we saw balance as a solution of sorts, I don't' know, I
think it's a pretty easy shortcut to see that you shouldn't' overdo somethings. I think the
more solution based, perhaps containing more input variables to measure whether a thing
was "in balance" or not, may be technically more accurate, but at the cost of ever being
useful in day to day life. You have to admit, many folk have neither the ability nor inclination
to overthink things, nor often moderately think things, so perhaps better we keep the
marketing up for balance instead of multi input solution based measurements.

There's this balance between conserving energy and finding new awesome resources. And
it's not just new resources that are physical in the real world, but mental ones as well,
because there's always a better way to understand the thing. There's always a, uh, a better,
uh, thing that can be learned, so to speak. And that progress, you know, led to tools, and led
to language, and writing, and city-states, and, you know, now we have nation-states. I think
that when you are feeling guilty that you haven't had the type of progress and production
that you think is possible in your life, uh, it definitely is possible. However, unless you're
some lucky mutant, you are going to need to bust your ass and use your brain, uh, the right
way, and use your thought the right way, and schedule the right things, uh, and you know,
either have the world's best discipline, or be a lucky mutant or understand that, you know,
it's a fight and it's a battle.

R228 & QE.228

If you dedicate yourself in a direction so hard and immerse yourself so hard in a behavior or
an outcome you begin to see the whole world through that lens. And it affects what you
think is important, it affects what you spend your time, it affects who you meet, it affects
where you exist and most of your life will be muted, deleted and unseen. You might neglect



family relationships, you might neglect showering, you might neglect knowing about the
news or brushing your teeth or eating. When you are so in a fixed state and addicted and
single minded and purpose and focused there's the risk that you have great personal pain
during those rare moments when you notice that you sacrificed much of what you might
want in your life for a different goal either by choice or by obsession; either through a
healthy decision or by having no choice and having an addiction.

Habits

Coaching

Tips for executing your vision in the real world.

If you want to help yourself get something creative done, or something hard done, I
think you may benefit from having a partner or coach that you answer to that expects
you to perform. It's much easier to let yourself down than it is to let your
friends/employees/coaches down. They will hold you to a tighter schedule. You will
deprive yourself of sleep, which enhances the chance that you will go to sleep earlier
that day, which increases the chance that you will wake up at the right time the next
day, so as to effortlessly be awake and able to put first the things that are most
important to you.

Pay a coach

Now you're paying to have someone that you don't want to let down. It's harder to let
him down than yourself.

Work with a coach regularly

If you don't have someone to hold you to that higher standard than you would
naturally have, you will sleep in, you will then go to sleep later, and you might find
yourself on a 26 hour long cycle when the days are only 24 hours long, and now you
can't stay synced up with any of the other people that you should be using to help you
be productive, nor even the stores you might be using to acquire food, etc.

Personal Commitments



This one is dangerous, many people make a commitment to do a thing, they tell all their
friends about it publicly. Then they proceeded to do the much easier thing, which is to go
back into doing the old behavior they were trying to get out of, and just never mention it
again in the hopes their friends forgot about it too, or fail to do what you said you would so
often that you just don't even care to pretend to be reliable or truthful in your personal
declarations in regards to what you will do, or when you will do it.

Thus if you commit to do things often, and don't' do them often, you have strengthened
your loser muscle, and increased your loser momentum. It would have been better for you
to have remained silent and been a loser in quiet instead of training negative and training to
break commitments and be untrustworthy. The later added insult to injury basically.

Stop starting, start finishing

Two statements appear to be true; "Stop starting new things, focus on finishing." That one
works if you already started on stuff. Then, another one is "stop focusing on finishing, focus
on starting." That one works, if you haven't started yet. They sound like opposites, but
they're both true at different times. Tommi's edit: If you haven't already started, do so. If
you've already started however, finish.

Doing to right thing is easier the longer you do it

The hard part of working out a gym, is getting to the gym. Once you're there, everything is
easy, you just do it. Getting there however, there's all kinds of good excuses to put it off till
later. That's because you think that you get to modify the behavior, you think it's ok if you
don't go, you export the real cost of not going. You see, when you don't go a single time to
the gym, you think that the entire cost of that not going is encapsulated in that single
workout that you missed. I don't' know anyone that accurately accounts for the fact that
with every single workout you miss, you are more and more likely to miss more workouts.

This isn't a way to understand only gym attendance, this is a way to understand all of the
behaviors you have in your life both good and bad. The longer you do a thing, the more
muscle memory and subconscious it is, the better you get at it, the more you enjoy doing it,
and the less you feel like it's something optional that you can displace with whatever else
shows up. In this life, the things that we are most likely to get are the things that we MUST
get. The things that are MUSTS's go first, and everything else get put after. In a world of
limited time, limited resources, and limited will power to do what you know you should.

I don't know which of the awesome behaviors you could have in your life you're currently
trying to integrate, I do know this tactics will help you make it happen.

When you're good at the level you're at you move on to the next level and you get whole
new problems. If you ask a really pretty guy how to meet girls, he'll tell you just smile. You
ask an ugly guy he's going to tell you every trick in the book. Same for business, guy who
gets lucky, picks the right business, he gets to have a whole new problem about scaling and
regulations and such. But the guy who doesn't get lucky, picks a hard business that's been
around for a long time, boy he's got to fight for every nickel.

Gamification tactics for useful behaviors

Some good tactics should be found out of the cancerous casual gaming wallet emptying
strategies. Maybe time gating can get people to write books, that's what the Pomodoro
method is right? What other tactics could work? Jingling sounds in the "casino acoustics"
genre? They've found a way to addict humans to useless behaviors, let's find ways to addict
humans to useful ones!

You get what you focus on, so do others it seems, they sense your focus

It's funny how what you read during the day is what other people are working on and their
opinions of what they've read. So the more popular and worked on a thing is, the more
worked on a popular it will be in the short and medium term. Think of how many copies of
the same move you've seen come out at the same time, like nearly the same movie, twin
movies they're called.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin films

This is the kind of thing that happens in business and art and all things that involve humans
attention as well. Someone gets a good idea, mentions, it, now it's another person's good
idea too. I think this is a reason that jealousy and competition are closely related concepts in
that, you become aware of a strategy that works and gets a result you want, and now you
want to compete and dominate, and do the same.

You could actually use this tactic against other countries to make them less effective by
convincing the people of that country that certain members of their group were benefitting
from an actually stupid behavior, say winning at video games. Then this would addict other
citizens of that country to want to compete in that thing. Perhaps gaming is too fun to make
fun of. Think of the classic "pissing contest" could there be a larger waste of time than to
see who can piss farther? Now imagine that it's not so obvious, or tripped enough
interesting to human triggers, and now it's an addiction.

How much of our disempowering addictions and habits are the result of entering our
consciousness through someone else falling for the addiction, and so the virally bad
behavior has its patient 0 through which it infects the rest of us.

This happens internally in your own life without looking at anyone else at all, the things you
are used to doing, you'll want to continue doing, and the things that you're not used to
doing are more likely to be stopped. So the lesson is, if you starve the bad behaviors, you
forget to do them, because you're too busy doing the new ones that you've done long
enough to stick. Thus, starve the bad behaviors for 3 weeks, and see them become week. Do
the new behaviors for 3 weeks and see them become strong.



This timing is probably depended on the individual but they're only matters of degree. This
is the same reason it's so important to be very serious about not having long breaks when
you're doing a new workout plan, or perhaps whatever else your new year's resolution
might have been. Those little missed instances of the new behavior you are supposed to be
doing are the virus of bad behavior trying to get a foot hold, and each consecutive screw up
is vastly more dangerous than the last. And when you've missed probably 4 or 5 of a thing in
a row, well now you just might never get around to it again. Maybe next year. This
combined with it being easier to keep doing a thing once you've started, where 80 percent
of the mental hardness of a thing is getting yourself to start, and 20 percent is actually the
doing of the thing. Those 2 things are why no 0 days works well as a strategy for
performance. You don't' have to kick all the ass in the world, but you must have no days
where you do nothing.

Focus

What you focus on

You focus on what you don't want, only long enough, to invert it, and find what you
do want, so you can focus on that. Then, you actually don't' focus on what you do
want either. You only focus on what you do want, long enough to calculate the stuff
you do to get it, and then you focus on that. Once you know what you need to do to
get stuff, you don't focus on the those things anymore, you focus on your schedule,
and hitting your short term goals. If you look at the things you want, you are not
looking at what you need to do. If you are looking at what you don't' want, you are
not looking at what you need to do.

Only action matters, and dreaming is only useful to action as long as you need it to
create the plan. Once you have the plan, stop dreaming and do. Your goals and
dreams are really only as useful as they point to correct actions you take. And your
knowledge of correct actions are only as useful as you can actually act on them.

Focus on the results your decisions will get you

Time shifting can save you, or drown you. If you're going to optimize for the future,
stay focused on it, and feel good. If you're going to optimize for the present, stay
focused on the present and feel good. If you make choices for the future, but only
focus on the present, you'll be unhappy, and vice a versa.

We want cake now, and we want to be skinny in the future. We don't want to do our
homework now, but we want good grades. Because they are binary propositions, you
can't have your cake and eat it too, so to speak, you always can be unhappy. If you eat
your cake now, you can fuck your happiness up by thinking about fat future you. If you
don't have the cake, focusing on fit future you, you get to fuck up the present,
regretting not eating the cake. If you want it, the unhappiness of not getting the other
things on the menu, because you can only choose one, is always there to help make
you unhappy. Obviously more choices should make you happier. Oddly enough, in the
real world it doesn't, and its actually scientifically proven to make you less happy, xx
Reference TED talk speaker who explains that more choices leads to unhappiness,
partly because you can't feel good knowing you made the right choice, when there's
too many choices. This is also why most sales optimized websites offer you 3 price




points to choose from, not because they have to, or because it even makes sense, but
because you will feel better choosing one, and they will make more sales, and happier
customers.


There's this concept of heads I win tails you lose - which is similar to the Catch 22 -
which is similar to the damned if you do damned if you don't. I'm going to add a new
level of resolution on understanding to the concept. What will happen is, you’ll make
a decision based on a feeling that you have. I'm kind of bored with the dieting trope,
but I'll use it for this example. You'll say: it's summer or I've had some drinks or it's
Friday or I've been doing good on my diet or whatever excuse is. Then you'll say: you
know what I want to treat myself and I'm going to have something tastes really good
and that's not the problem. The problem is, that you get some of the taste, and a lot
of it you swallow so quick that your poor little tongue doesn't even get a chance to
enjoy it.

You have to keep stuffing more in there to get the flavor. Sometimes you're engaged
in conversation or listening to music or listening thinking about the future thinking
about the past. You're halfway done with your dessert and you don't even remember
what the fuck it taste like. Because you weren't paying attention. If you were to die
after that moment, I would say that would be a good decision statistically. The chance
that you die after that dessert is very low. Therefore you live, and live long enough to
regret that decision. What does that regret look like? How is it similar to all the other
regrets that you have, for decisions that you made. That were the right thing at the
time. But later on weren't the right thing.

Food is one of them. Committed on the lips a lifetime on the hips. Let's say you have a
lot of money. You say, you know what I have a lot of money and I don't like spending it
shopping. I don't like spending a transporting things. I don't particularly like shipping
fees. If I buy something I might as well buy fucking two of them. Unless it's food and it
rapidly spoils. If something doesn't rapidly spoil and doesn't rapidly depreciate and
you can save on shipping fees and save on the concept of adding to shopping cart and
going through checkout process and finding it again. Then you might as well buy two.

It makes total complete sense when you do it. Then future you comes along. The
future you is optimizing for a different set of outcomes. That person says I want more
space in my house and a better version of this thing. Now future you wants to sell the
thing.

This is one example you could use food. Where you're fat fuck looking at your
stomach, going: how did we get here? Compared to when you're at lunch going: you
know I'm sick of dieting I just want to enjoy some food for once. What is the right
decision for one moment and the short amount of time thereafter, is a wrong decision
for another time and it is a real-life execution of the damned. If you do damned if you
don't based on time. The level of abstraction, the extra level of understanding that I'm
sticking on top of this, that damned if you do damned if you don't, appears to apply to
a specific slice of time, which is nearby. Whereas the understanding that I'm trying to
impart, is not that you're damned if you do damned if you don't. But that you're not
damned now, but you are damned then. The reason for that is because your desire
changes, your goals change.



Now this has been explained in other words and analyzing why it is that, right before
you're about to go to sleep you dream of conquering the world and doing all of these
wonderful things that you've never done before. Learning a new language and
learning to dance and seeing the world and writing that novel you've always been
meaning to write. Eating more healthily and going to gym all that bullshit seem so
easy and so nearby and so motivating when you're about to go to sleep. Because, you
get all of the feelings of the benefits with none of the cost that you shortly have to
actually do the shit where as soon as you wake up. In the beginning of the day has
occurred and you're not about to go to sleep you have an actual opportunity to do
these things. The benefit seems just as real however, the cost seems so very much
larger. Because you would have to put down the fucking croissant. Grab some salad or
just enjoy the feeling of being hungry.

That time shifting in your own mind which I've documented elsewhere in the book,
because it has been studied, that time shifting in your mind fucks you so that
whatever decision you make, that would be right in the short term, will fuck you over
with interest later. That I haven't found a good way to overcome because there isn't a
good way to overcome it. You either learn to time shift in your brain and try and
cancel out the effects of this real-world time shifting, so you take the world time
shifting of: I'm going to not eat this delicious food now, so that I can have fitness later.
You try and shift your mind to match the reality and the reality is like, you're going to
try and shift those future benefits into the present. You're going to try and feel those
future benefits in the present. In neuro-linguistic programming they call it future
pacing. That's like the best chance you have, of feeling good depriving yourself of
something that would quite easily and quite readily bring you emotional joy.

Who doesn't enjoy the feeling of filling up on fucking delicious cake. Food, well people
with mental illnesses like anorexia or people that have trained themselves to
deliberate action over and over and over again. To hunt something else, like fitness.
They don't have room for kick because they're so busy doing kale or whatever other
horrible tasting bullshit they have found a way to addict themselves to.

The important part of this summary is that damned if you do damned if you don't
Catch 22 the fucking you get for the fucking you got. I think that the other reference
that they've studied involves some word like satiation. Whenever you make a decision
to save money now, oh by the way the grass is always greener on the other side. The
problem with the grass is always greener on the other side is, it means that no matter
what side you pick when you look at the other grass it's fucking greener. The funny
part is that you could actually like have factual representation physically because your
perspective of the grass changes for when you're standing directly above it and for
when you're viewing it from the side. That also mirrors what would be expected in
reality because these plants, the whole reason they have leaves, or foliage
whatsoever, is to absorb light from the Sun. And, the Sun is always above them.
Whereas you as a human are only above in a similar position to the Sun. That grass
which is directly below you.



The saying that the grass is always greener on the other side, it may not just be a
colloquialism. It may actually have physical optical representation in the real world.
Would be interesting to study. Wouldn't surprise me at all. Why would a plant spend
time, whatever optical properties a plant has from the side are very likely and
predictably different from them optical properties it would have from above. Because
it gets its fucking food from above eighty percent more than it gets its food from the
side.

Moral of the story: you're going to make decisions that you fucking regret no matter
what. Because what you optimize for in the short term is not going to be the same
thing in the long term. As you flip flop between the two, you can't win. Oh I saved all
this money to build a big business. But I can't buy back those years of decreased
quality of life by not spending that money earlier. Oh I'm with one girl therefore I'm
not with another girl. How do you win that one? Be with no girls? Be with all the girls?

Order of operations - Behaviors

If you were a hippy tree hugger before your Tony Robbins event, you will be a larger one
after the event. If you were a money hungry business killing machine before, now you're a
bigger money hungry killing machine. Same applies to meditation and money, if you
adopted meditation because you wanted to become more powerful in business, its likely
your meditation will bring you there.

Loserness momentum

It's funny, if you have a weekend, life's good and on Monday you can function well, if you
have a 3 day weekend, even better, yay, more rest and relaxation. On day 4 though, you
become a zombie and forget how to function as a human being. Schedules shaving,
showering, these things all become optional. I'd say it's an example of if you have a cheat
day or slip a little bit, now you're in rolling friction instead of starting friction, and it's easier
to keep slipping, just like locking up your brakes on a car or slipping on ice.

Diet, habit change

Diet immersion, 4x slower loss =4x more risk at least, if you go out with friends, hold you to
old lifestyle, and don't know calories, and you eat more of the tasty food because it tastes
good, and you try more items because you don’t go out that often, and 1 cheat day leads to
more cheat days. Also the slower you see your first kg lost, the more likely you are to give
up before you ever build the habit that makes continuing easy.

Procrastination

There are shitloads of threads on hacker news where they talk about procrastination, such
as this one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11595947

Frustration, focus, habits

Frustration exists because in the old days it helped us avoid infinite loops of behavior, now
the shit we do is lOx harder, so we need focus, or habit or meds to move the frustration
threshold.

Don't call personal excellence "self-help" - change habits

Calling books on how to kick ass "self-help" is kind of fucked up and stupid, because it's
quite often that the people that read these books are far and beyond far less needing of
help than those that aren't smart enough to read this excellent and life changing material
over all of the other shit that is on the book shelves. Who came up with that dumb ass title?
How is personal excellence in any way similar to "self-help"? It would be funny to have the
quote out of that movie where the guy who played in the first Fargo TV-series said "the



problem with you guys is that you are doing self-help, and yourself already sucks, so you're
being helped by an asshole, yourself" something along those lines.

There is no winning it

Whatever you choose to eat you are not eating something else. I'm not sure the mental
shortcut that one should use to override that is that the Pareto principle? That you should
just be fucking happy and assign everything in the top eighty percent the same level of
excellence. Maybe that's it. I don't know what I should call it or name it. I don't think that's
'grass is always greener on the other side' fucking you get for fucking you got 'damned if you
do damned if you don't'.

I don't think any of those expressions properly recognized the time value. I think that they
all execute too recently programmatically. I would like to see something that involves today
and tomorrow as a saying in regards to decision making. That in the future when you realize
that you're fucked at least you can reverse future pace and think about the benefit that you
got in the past.

Do you even produce bro?

Yeah I better produce this book quick. Because when I have to start repeating content -
because it's been so long since I said it, that I don't remember whether I said it or not. I'm
going to have a lot of fucking duplicates. This one is about tortured geniuses. Isn't it
interesting that some of the most productive and effective people in the world are fucking
tortured. I would say that they are tortured and productive because that productivity relieve
their pain just ever so slightly. Whereas these hippie bastards spend all their time happy as
fuck they but don't have to produce for happiness and thus they don't produce and thus
they have shittier health and countries without borders being taken over by their neighbors.

solving that you do doesn't work on the next puzzle. If you are really good at chess, you're
not really good at world of war craft, if you're really good at war craft you're not good at
star craft if you are good at StarCraft you're not good at league of legends, and if you're
good at league of legends you're not good at poker. Basically every single game that you get
good at (that was created by another person) sucked away the conscious processing power
of mankind double fold. Once for the creator (or more, depending on how many people it
took to develop it), and once for the solver (or more, depending on how many people play
it), and thus what you find is that in this world of real problems that when solved, have
much greater measurable benefit than these artificially created human challenges of trivial
value. Basically the equation is that human consciousness is being sucked into these pools of
fake game solving that could be used to solve real things.

Addiction

Psychological Addiction & People paid to abuse your psychology

I was addicted to games for a decade or so. At least for two decades I almost had a
crippling game addiction. If you are quite lucky to have achieved enough to get a lot of
free time, you know, yeah, I spent years on those games. But I got nothing out except
the ability to confess how horrible it was. Moreover, there are teams of people who
are very well paid and very intelligent; their only goal is to make you addicted. They
are paid to abuse your own psychology, to damage your personality, to destroy
themselves and the world we are living in. They may make money, but they have sold
their souls, and they may not realize it until it is too late.

well then, you're not adding anything to the world. You're just the world's shittiest version
of Google. If you spend all your time absorbing content and not creating any, well then,

whatsoever. Maybe you should customize the reddits.

Sports are a means to an end, the end is love and significance. It's important to not see
them as ends. How important is our ability to put a rubber ball through a piece of metal / a
basketball, soccer ball, foosball. How much time should we spend on this? I have an idea, if
we had to go to war, and we had to win, and we had a way to consume the enemies
population with gaming, they surely would lose, perhaps even before their 10th
achievement trophy.

How gross is it that teams and teams of people are sitting in rooms right now, scheming of
ways to addict the youth to basically mental death. I might be exaggerating a bit, because
games you participate in are way better than games you just watch. Participating beats the
crap out of spectating. Sadly though, the same mental triggers that have served us so well
throughout the years are stealing away from us our ability to reach the next level. The level
where we don't become permanently extinct.

If you spend your time figuring out how to brainwash kids to grind and grind out the same
recycled garbage content, and sacrifice their life force and time to get another gem, or
sword or gun, or trophy. Fuck you sincerely. Can you please take your manipulation skills
and brainwashing skills and gamification skills, and go fucking gamify the real world, so we
can fucking survive. You can tell I've wasted a whole lot of my live, and I'm pretty sore about
it.

Even the slave masters are slaves. How fun must it be to create ways to addict people to
beat the same boss 10 times the games steal your soul even while you sleep. Your dreams
are consumed by the grind.

Now that the butt-hurt is over, I saw a pretty interesting interview with some suit working at
nestle, and the interviewer said, you guys focus on selling healthy foods, and you sell
chocolate, is the chocolate healthy, and the guy responded in a pretty genius way. He said,
there are no unhealthy foods, only unhealthy diets. And I was like, damn dude! yeah, that's
actually legit.

It's probably true for games as well, some gameplay is probably great for the same reason
its great in the wild. There's just some damn things that cross the line, and when you aim for
crushing addiction and hours stolen as your goal, fuck you. Go steal someone else's life.
When you see a movie, it has an end. When you play an MMORPG they own your fucking
soul.

It's not just MMORGs, its Nascar, the NFL, you fucking name it, they want your hours, and
more importantly they want your fucking money. Southpark had a great episode on it,
making money on the backs of the addicted. You should watch it.

Here's the situation we're in as human beings, I could focus on myself and my loved ones,
and our survival, in which case I need lots of people to get their shit together, including
myself. If we change our goals. We stop caring about ourselves. We care only about those
that come long after us. Then we can shift our focus to becoming multi-planetary. Of course,
it kind of sucks that the only way that pays off, is when one of our planets gets destroyed,
otherwise, well, the insurance policy never really paid for itself.



I'd much rather bet the whole farm on this one egg basket not blowing up, then I might get
to survive, without rolling the dice of deciding to move to mars or not, and watch one or the
other planets fail. Who am I kidding? I'm going to die of some boring shit, being complacent,
a lifelong collection of should of and could ofs culminating in a whimper, not a bang.

Or we could fight, we could fucking fight, we could love and we can fuck and we can fight,
and take our fucking destiny. We need only unplug our cocks from our hands and put them
to good work on the world around us. Wash them first.

The time sink of the other sex

You rarely hear about great men being womanizers or great dancers as well for greatness
tends to require a fair amount of time to cultivate and outcompete your fellow woman, and
so it's very likely that if you want to be greater than other people on the thing, you'll need to
put in more focus and more time at the sacrifice of other things that they will have time for,
because they haven't made the same sacrifices. Luckily the world is so lazy compared to
what's possible that you don't really have to make that many sacrifices in the grand scheme
of things, because you can get quite a lot done in the time that everyone else is literally
fucking off and doing things they barely even enjoy.

Beware however that the other reason that you don't see a lot of great men great at more
than a single thing is because it's also just a function of your filter, even if the other thing
that you ere selecting for wasn't great at all, and it was just say, being 6 feet tall, or having
green eyes, you'd still knock out a lot of candidates just with that rather non great selector.

I can tell you that being a good womanizer is very, very time consuming, you will spend your
days hunting, and scheming, and dating, and gaming, and fucking, and in the end, you're
very likely to get the same results out of it that most other men have. They in general don't
become rich, nor powerful, for making women want to have sex with you one by one is
more of a sales thing, and less of a product development thing.

Success/failure cycle timing

Every time you go out and don't pull, you have a real cost, and unless you have much better
than average state management, you will be riding a suck cycle, so I'd suggest only going out
to pull if you can continue to do that long enough to get a win and ride it. If you have a win,
and then go cancel it out by getting a loss and riding the loss, you're likely to focus and feel
the more recent event over the better farther away one. This applies to games, and love,
and all other matters of rage if you lose, joy if you win, we have emotional momentum as
humans.

Pareto principle
Scaling

Car detailers live far outside the Pareto 80 / 20 effectiveness principle. That's why no
matter where you go in your life you could stare at a thing and make it ever so
incrementally better all day long and unless that scales to other people, great. But if
it's only for you only for a single other person you're probably wasting your time.

R734

Diminishing returns

Being a jack a jack of all trades is better than going deeper and skill, because going to deeper
on a skill just gets you incremental returns. Whereas, its binary if you're missing component
to get your business complete, you're not in business. But if you just suck and get a little bit
of all the components done then you are in business. Then you can incremental improve.



You can't really improve what doesn't exist. Therefore jack of all trades and
entrepreneurship needs to come before deep diving into improvement. I think that's the
same reason that hoarding exist. Because, you need all of the things more than you need
more of a thing. That's like the concept behind essential vitamins. You don't need more, you
need just that one.

R730

Skill momentum turning cost

If you are a complete neophyte at something, it costs you quite literally nothing to learn one
better format over a different perhaps more common but worse format. For example
qwerty versus dvorak typing. However, if you are extremely proficient at the qwerty
keyboard format, then you will incur a gigantic up front cost to switching, that the new
person doesn't. Thus Experts pay a much higher cost to change course than noobs. You
could call this skill momentum. I think I can make a cooler name for this.

Hobbies are time consuming

I think it's amazing how few hobbies you can really have. They're time consuming as shit.
Took me half a day to build my own power strip, which I'd like to turn into a business to tell
you the truth. Every single little thing you want to do that you don't think so take a lot of
time, "Oh I'll just lift some weights" "I'll just, you know check some sports" - takes twenty,
thirty percent are useful hours in a fucking day. You only get to do about five of those until
you're out of time. You're now product of your hobbies, instead of - a human.

R686

Recovering all the time

Another reason endurance sport suck is because not only do they take longer, they take
longer to recover to from too, and then you're really tired as well. I mean, you're really sore
as well, so you not only lose the time it takes going and flopping about, you also lose the
time going and driving to where these faraway places that you can flop about in for a very
long time, and then recovering, and then being sore, and then going to sleep earlier.

R659

Avoid the common fuckups

Don't sweat the small stuff, by knowing what the big stuff is.

Not noticing that you're chasing a small ass percentage difference that doesn't matter.
Another common mistake is mistaking linear changes in a number for importance,
when that change is small as hell as a percentage. What really is the difference
between being able to type 115 and 119 words per minutes? And how many hours of
testing and practice eat into whatever useful gain could be had. The time I've spent
overclocking and typing faster will never be recovered in actuality, I will forever be
cash negative on the endeavors. It is an insurance policy that you can buy very
expensively in your "free" time. That would pay in the event that for reasons outside
your control something needed to be done very rapidly, and due to your low ROI,
spending many hours making things faster, you could win back some of the time
through the increased speed. It's like being in a race, and trying to do some pushups
real quick at the start so you could try and run faster. The time for practice is before



the race. Bad analogy, the idea is, if you slow yourself down trying to go faster, it can
actually be a net loss. You might want to stick with the computer you have for as long
as possible, and as far as typing goes, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Google and their
Al team has speech recognition entirely solved for English speakers in the not so
distant future.

Being great at the wrong things
Faster, louder, stupider

I used to own a car stereo store, we would make peoples cars as loud as possible,
particularly in the bass area. Now when you are younger you don't have quite the same
empathy or knowledge of what other people are thinking about you, or how you may be
affecting other people's lives. Such was the case with the very loud vehicles I drove around.

Get this, amongst people that are into the car stereo scene, there's actually something
called a SPL contest, or dB drag racing. Basically you armor your car, turn it into a giant
concrete box, fill it with speakers that are only great at playing a single frequency (which is
basically the opposite of music). Then you try to hit that tone, and usually break much of the
speakers and car and amplifiers during the process. Also you most likely drove that car to
the show on a trailer, because it was far too dangerous and unreliable and slow to drive of
its own volition.

Equally as stupid as incentivizing the destruction of cars into science projects to make noise
in very short bursts. I'd say drag racing and fast cars are just about as stupid. The death tolls
are gigantic, and once again I'm guilty of playing into that stereotype of boy racer as well. I
wonder if I'm executing any bad ideas disguised as good ideas right now? Come to think of
it, if you look at all the things on the magazine stand in your local book store or
supermarket, I think you will find that we humans have all kinds of inane and backwards
hobbies.

Hoarding

How about the irrational hoarding of things? I guess if you are artful enough with it, you
don't look like a generic keep all the things hoarder, but to some degree you are fulfilling the
same driving impetus. I guess you could call it a sport to find all the stupid things you're
doing that don't fit with what you'd say a fulfilling and rewarding life for you would look like.
It's also funny how these things change massively with age. You don't' see a lot of young
kids worry about politics, and you don't see a lot of 40 year old people worrying about doing
BMX tricks on their bicycle.

Some stupid things stay for the long haul, some go away, and some come anew. I haven't
really thought about gardening too much, but I would imagine that if there was some time
of break in the normal food distribution systems, you would dearly wish that your roses
were perhaps more eatable and more the size of say, pumpkins. I don't know too many
young people that are into gardening.

Hobbies

If you look at the Wikipedia on hobbies, you'll see that there's not actually too many of
them. There's less than 300, that's pretty damn surprising to me. The next time you're
bored, you've got a great excuse, there's only 300 things to fool around with. Just kidding,
there's a fair amount of depth to many of them.

Cutting out transition time



Transition time and time management

If you want to know how important transition time is, you basically have 16 hours left in a
day after you have sleep; and that doesn't include the transition from waking up, brushing
your teeth, eating, eating, eating, talking to people putting on clothes taking off clothes
driving to and from work. So basically if you want to know how important it is to cue out
transition time out of your life, just assume that you had to spend all of your time in
transition, so what if your time to and from work, walking or driving that's all you ever did
you slept (pulled over to the side of the road). That would be an unfulfilling life, you
wouldn't enjoy it, and so it's very likely that cutting that out in its entirety would add great
value to your life.

R101

Look girls, life is made of time. If you spend 25% of your working hours of a fucking day
doing something which disappears the moment you go to sleep, it literally dies the moment
you lay your head to bed. Man, you are recreating the same work over and over and over
and over and over and over again, and it doesn't stack, it doesn't build, it doesn't scale. Fuck,
you wouldn't even need to do it if everyone else would be willing to lower the fucking arms
race.

R183 & QE.183
Cutting out transition

Its way easier to do some squats in your living room than it is to get dressed, then go to the
gym, then do squats there, then shower, then return home, and now you are back where
you could have fucking been with 1 hour less spent. Like literally a fucking hour, why waste
the hour of your life? Are you actually hitting on people at the gym / if you're not why the
fuck would you go there, perhaps you like sports, and that takes more people, I guess in that
case it could be cool. Sadly, it's hard to have a squash court in your building.

Preparation application ratio

There's something I call the preparation- application ratio, and basically you will hear, and maybe
miss- attribute it, that Abraham Lincoln said "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I'll spend
the first four sharpening my axe." There's many different useful variations of similar ideas, such as
"Give me a lever long enough and I move the world" or "The early bird gets the worm." What are
these things? When preparation meets opportunity, that's what luck is. There's all these
statements regarding the effectiveness of preparation. Good outcomes are not universally
affected in the same way by good preparation. In some places preparation leads to amazingly
great force multiplication, and in other places good preparation doesn't make much of a
difference. How would I explain that?

Let's say you're planning to go to a weightlifting championship, and you've been training for six
months, lifting weights constantly to get ready, and you miss your last work out. How much of an
effect is that going to have on you? I don't think very much. You might even do better depending
on whether you're over training or not. Now let's say you're going to sit down to eat dinner and
you've got Sloppy Joe sitting in front of you but no bread, just pulled pork and you have to choose
whether you're going to just try to eat it with your hands or get up and get a fork.

In this case the time spent getting a fork is going to pay off huge, just in the savings of having the
not look like an animal when you're eating and clean the living shit out of your hands, because it's
going to be really messy, right. There's places where preparation is super, super important and
pays off really well and there's places where preparation is really just application. Like sharpening



your axe and using your axe have nothing in common. The preparation is like orthogonal. It's like
at right angles to its related but not the same thing. Sharpening your axe and like chopping a tree
down with your axe, they don't have shit in common right.

But like painting and learning how to paint you're just painting, right? You're not like cleaning
your brushes. You're just painting, right. There're some things where preparation is identical to
application and you're just doing it for lots of time and then there's other places where
preparation has nothing to do with application. It seems to me that those places get much more
bang for the buck, right? For instance if you had to practice opening lines if you're if you like to go
out into public and meet people, and you use openers to like meet new people, like whatever your
opener happens to be.

You can sit at home and practice it you know against the wall. Or you could try it out in public it's
probably better to try down public. Learning some new ones that you didn't previously know,
that's different, right? Because you're getting information from somewhere that's not yourself and
you know, that would be more of like a sharpening an axe type of behavior. When opportunity
meets preparation that's luck, that's a cool saying, I like it. It's unfortunate that we can't just a sign
like a flat this is the percentage of time that you should assign to like improvement, development
and then this is the percentage of time that you could assign application.

You can't invent such a percentage, because of that wild difference between some preparations
only are just doing the same of the thing and so that really the preparation is just more
application. Then other things where the preparation isn't application at all, right. Having a fork is
like so useful compared to just like trying to eat food with your hands if it's a messy food. That's
another type of sideways preparation, having some type of sculpted metal tool has nothing in
common with like sticking food in your mouth with your hands and chewing it with your mouth.
R785

The forms of preparation that have the most payoff in the least time are those where the
preparation is most different from the application. Sharpening an axe is very useful, because it has
no similarity to the actual application of the axe towards its target. It's also only as useful as your
axe was dull in the first place. Over-preparation in one area leads to under preparation in another.
I've always like the idea of not all years of experience having the same value. There's a great
comic: where 80 x 1 year old babies have 80 years of combined experience.

Playing the odds with life
Wasting life

I can't believe I wasted, and or didn't do anything that I can remember at all with the last 10
years of my life. 12 even. The best years? That's why it's so fucking important that you do
things that checkpoint in your mind, you must do things that have lasting value and impact,
if not for the world, at least yourself, because one day you’ll wake up and ask yourself where
the fuck did my life go? Dickens process.

Playing the odds with life

That's a time frame issue, it's very likely that everything we do is likely to fail, it is very likely
that I am going to meet the same fate as everyone that came before me therefore you must
play the odds, so am I on a calorie restricted diet starving myself? Nope. I like food, isn't that
going to make me die earlier? Yup. I don't get it, how can you do that? Well I'm playing the
odds that this live forever shit doesn't work out, and so I've got to get the quality while I'm
here, so I walk a fine line between enjoyment and savings, I walk a fine line between



spending and savings, between treating my girl really good and not so good, between
working out and taking a break, having a drink. And if you don't work that fine line and you
don't perform that balance you're very likely to end up in pain, because a lack of balance is
the definition of pain. God that sounds so good, let me write that shit down. Heh this dude
Richard, he loves to hear himself talk, fucking conceited faggot. Lack of balance is the
definition of pain, yeah sweet. And it really is actually the definition of pain, but you could
extend that argument to anything.

Music

Bass feeling goes up faster than sound feeling, especially if you're coupled by something
other than air.

Seems like the tactile sensation increases much quicker with the bass than the volume
does, so at low volume you're not feeling much, and turn it up a bit and you're feeling
a lot. I guess it makes sense that if you're physically touching the subwoofer, that you



would be getting much more energy than your ears, because the more you pump into
the air to move it, the more is wasted in all other directions, but the more you move
that sub, the amount hitting you is quite direct, and your ears are exponentially
harder to perceive loudness (lOdb Is 2x as loud perceptually but 3db is actually 2x
more energy. So what you perceive isn't oddly tied to the real energy. )

You ever want to feel the bass, see if you can get your sub to rest on your chair. Free

Porn for power

If men lift more weights when exposed to sexual images, then it obvious, that like color, you can
trigger your mind into different states of performance. What would happen if you triggered your
subconscious with an image on screen just long enough to activate your subconscious into the
behavior you want. If red makes time slow down (increases processing speed) then flash full
screen red every so often. If beautiful men and women or erotic photos increase your heart rate
and dilate your pupils, perhaps that can give you a rush too (this trope was in the movie "Fight
club").

The trick, like flirting, is to keep the heartrate high, but not get distracted from the task at hand. If
you go from being aroused to jerking off, you will lose the "drive" you might have had.

If I can measure your heartrate and pupil dilation, and I can sucessfully show your subconscious
images that your conscious can't detect, I should be able to tell If you're a pedofile, or gay, or
sadist, or masochist, by tying your responses to the images that you're seeing. Now, you could
royally fuck up, as other body response readers do (lie detectors) and consfuse stress with arousal,
or you might think an image means x, but in their map of the world it means Y. So you would
probably have to focus hard on the difference between the giving and receivng end of things. You
could do this by putting the camera in the "eyes" of the person, or by using virtual reality.

Using this response blueprint you could then tailor an attention maintaining app which you place
under the work that you want to fall in love with.

Introduction

What is a great, productive environment? What does it feel, sound, smell and look like?

This is your stuff. As many creatures have discovered over time, having things, and places,
that you call your own, and are willing to fight to keep exclusively yours pays great
dividends. If you're hungry, you can go grab an apple off of your apple tree, drink some milk
from your cow, or you might go hunting with your family on your land and kill an animal to
eat. Having the exclusive right to do those things enhances the chance that you and your
family eat, while it decreases the chance that others who aren't aligned with you do. We
didn't invent territory. Lots and lots of other creatures figured out that idea on their own as
well - property works.

Thus, having the coolest stuff and living amongst it can bring great joy, and make everything
in life much more enjoyable. If you're going to listen to wonderful music late at night in your
home, wouldn't it be great to listen to it on the best speakers, in a beautiful room that
worked well with the speakers in delivering that experience directly into your soul? There's
some songs so moving and powerful that you can literally have goosebumps on your arms
and tears in your eyes.

Stuff matters. Thus, let's have the coolest stuff:)

Some stuff lets you have magic moments easier, perhaps you love the sea, then perhaps for
you a boat could be wonderful. Some stuff makes you more effective. If you care about
what color things are, and you shop on the internet, or like to design things, having a color
accurate monitor could enhance your purchasing decisions and your ability to share your
creations with the world.

One shouldn't need much space to explain the virtues of stuff for it is where we humans
spend much of our time when not at home. In the malls and shops of the world, idly
shopping for enjoyment. Ask any teenager how few places they are allowed to legally exist
in, and you'll be surprised to discover that within their budget, the only places they can
really exist or hang out with friends are malls, or you're stuck in the cold, the rain and wind
of the world, which gets real un-fun real quick.








It would be wonderful if the youth of our world had more empowering and useful places to
legally exist other than shopping malls. Surely the shopping mall is not the highest and best
form of leisure activity or location that we can come up with for the most valuable future
resource on our planet, our youth. Or hell, yourself. Wouldn't you love for someplace to
exist worth visiting after hours that wasn't a pool hall, bowling alley, bar or nightclub? We
can dream. Shit happens, so they say. Another funny saying is, the road to hell is paved with
good intentions, regardless of how forcefully you might command yourself to do a thing,
yourself often has its own short term and hedonistic imperatives.

The value of windows

Do you ever look in a window and see eyes staring back at you? What percentage of
the possible eyes in that room you see could be looking back at you? I think you will
find that unless you live in some type of odd twilight zone episode, that most people
are too busy looking at each other, or books or screens or work, to look outside for
too long periods. Let's be serious, if you have time to look out the window and stare,
you have the same time that you could be out there with those people you're staring
at, and hear, smell, and absorb the experience, instead of being an isolated voyeur.

I'd make the case that as long as your vitamin D is good, windows are pretty
overrated. You could say that it changes the way a man feels, and if it's the case well,
I'd happily sacrifice a window for better sounding space (check out the NY Times
article xx), or for higher ceilings and some art. Perhaps windows are like the beach; if
you live near it, you never go, but if you live on it, you go all the time, it's that magic
threshold. Funny I Googled that and some smart folks have already looked into it.

Mirrors

If you're setting your rear-view mirror, there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. If
you see a lot of glare and light that's blurring your ability to see, should probably try
the other way. Xx Meta?

Towel tips

Towels often have a side with more absorption on it and a side with less. If you're
trying to dry yourself off, use the side with more surface area.

Benefits of pet ownership

Work

Workstation

Speaker optimization
Genelec

Dirac or GLM 2.0 from Genelec (GLM cheaper, you can correct every room
and seating position for as many places as you want with a single GLM git,
and just tell the monitors to use the stored settings in them, (it's a dip
switch on the back.) The hours you can spend optimizing sound is fucking
insane. Xx Too specific for book? Will become outdated?

Audio

Absorb primary reflections, put subwoofer where your head is and move
around free RTA on phone and white noise on YouTube repeater to move



phone around and detect where you should put the subwoofer to get
good response at your head (since they are invertible, you can switch your
head and the sub and its amplitude should still be maximized).

Workstation Effectiveness

Control phone from computer

Control phone from computer so you don't have to move hands off
keyboard and mouse, or look at device or manage device, eyes, hands
where they need to be to kick ass. If you're not in your kicking ass station,
you're probably not kicking ass.

Workstation idea

Workstation mirrors to see behind you (like in a car).

Monitor

Monitor shifting

Your monitor will shift right naturally because we justify content left,
shifting most of the text and data to the left. If you split a screen into two,
your right screen will start in the middle and go right nicely, whereas your
left monitor will start far left, far from the center, and will be harder to
read. So you can cheat a bit by shifting your monitor a little left. This does
screw with potentially posture, and the performance of your audio system
(might block a speaker) and with the color and brightness response of
your screen depending on how linear your screens performance is off
access.

Screen Resolution

You want to work at the smallest resolution comfortable, so you can see
more data at the same time, so you may have to push your display back,
zoom out, get a bigger monitor, get higher resolution. Whatever it takes
to match the resolving power of your fovea.

Typing will be super important until you can do good voice recognition,
but if you are near other people, you can't really be all speaking at the
same time, perhaps whispering though.

Windows desktop management

Winsplit revolution is all you need, does hotkeys, and mouse drag to
position (turn on drag 'n go).

Winsplit revolution (all product mentions need url forwarding for
affiliate programs, perhaps just link to my own site, and I can
change and update as the world improves!) (thus do not mention
actual products just the function of the product then I will proxy to
approved products on site.) Xx Meta

There's speed reading programs that move the text without you
having to move your eyes, and thus they increase the rate at which
you can read. If you subvocalize, it's said that chewing gum can
help, because it keeps your mouth busy and out of the way. If you
use that same idea, the fact is that your fovea is the limiting factor;
at about two feet, you can only see a quarter sized space in focus,
and everything else is out of focus. What is all the extra screen
space for? The same reason your eyes can see out that far in the



first place, your subconscious can still keep track of ideas and clues
going on around your central focused field of vision. Because of
that, you can keep a movie going, if that keeps you in the zone, or
an audio playlist, or a video or image of a beautiful landscape or
person, whatever tickles your fancy. This also means that you could
get almost as much effectiveness out of keeping what you need to
do directly in front of you, never turning your eyes or your head
away from it, and when you need to look at something else or be
notified of something else, you just keep it all stacked one after the
other in front of you.

Instead of organizing all the data and windows on a single screen in
front of you up and down, left and right, which will make you have
to move your eyes and head around, you can instead just stay
looking straight ahead and use alt tab, or the hotkeys and Windows
manager of your choice to cycle through them quickly. You can even
assign certain Window stop certain hotkeys, so that you're not
longer even relying on finding a window anymore, you can just pull
it up with a bad ass gaming mouse, or hotkey of your choice.

Sadly, like many things in the world, you have to practice to get
good at them. I haven't found a way to even categorize the million
windows I'll have open at a time, let alone assign them to hotkeys,
because they change all the time. Most of it is absorbing content
and knowledge that other people have generated and as such, it's
mostly browser windows, and once you have 100 new browser tabs
opened up, since they're all new, you can't really assign them to
crap. Perhaps you could have your browsers in a group of three;
work, play, buy, interesting, perhaps interesting 2 and interesting 3.
But even in that case, you're still going have like 20 sub tabs under
each window, seems like making numerical isn't all that easy. Might
just be easier to hit alt tab (enhance with power toy which makes
the interface larger, they probably fixed this in winlO).

A bigger screen is also great for impressing people, allowing others
to see what you're working on, giving yourself a nice wakeup with
some super bright light if you wish to crank up the lumens, heating
a room.

Color accuracy

I think it'd be a better way if everyone included a color square teller meter
thing that shows all the different colors against their product, so that you
can make up for whatever they fucked up when they shot it. They should
do the same thing for every video that gets broadcast. How do you know
what gamma they used? How do you know what your settings should be?
Well, they should tell you.

Display clutter

Hide clutter, display order is similar to hide weakness, display strength.

Common errors



Multiple screens instead of giant single screen. Multiple screens don't
work well for any games, all games support a single screen, few support
multi. What use is big black plastic bezels in the middle of the viewing
area? You run out of outputs on the cards to feed all the monitors.
Mounting them all and keeping them aligned is expensive and time
consuming. Projectors are often loud, hot, and when you look near their
source, blinding. They also force your environment to be always dark, and
they get bumped screwing up their alignment, and if someone walks near
them on a wood floor they can shake, if the music is loud they shake, and
if you're using projectors with dip's in them and you're sensitive to their
rainbows you can see literal red green and blue rainbows when you
quickly shift your eyes left to right. I learned these things the hard way.
Mouse buttons

It's a great idea to put all the hotkeys for audio and whatever else you will need
on a bad ass mouse, because every time you need to take your hand off that
mouse, you are losing time, and if you don't use the mouse that much, then it's
best that you break out tons of shortcuts on the keyboard. Truth be told, it's
probably best that you do that on both the keyboard and the mouse, so you
only need to switch when you must, not ever to just change a song, or move a
volume, or mute, etc.

Chair

Zero gravity is pretty awesome, whatever's the healthiest / comfortable / can
get in and out of comfortably for you, may live in it a while until you achieve
your dream.

Keyboard

Mechanical cherry brown keys

Quieter, faster for double tapping if you're doing anytime of key
spamming. If it needs to rest on your legs, and it slides around when you
don't want it to, blutak it, or grip tape it (skateboarding).

Skin feeling keycaps

The reason people like just the right texture of PBT keycap over ABS and
other types is because the feeling and sound of it seems very similar to
skin, and we are programmed to be social, so why not have some social
good feeling stuff in the things, which we touch with our hands. In this
case, keycaps.

Maybe a heated keyboard would increase the enjoyment of using the
keyboard? If you could get it to whatever the average hot chick's external
temperature is?

Hotkeys

Yes, everything has a hotkey, and if you think it should, and it doesn't,
then you can make one (Xx link to my site referencing auto hotkey landing
page).

Hitting keys

We understand typing as our fingers hitting keys, but our body doesn't
understand it that way. Our body understands that your arms are in this
position and when your arms are in this position, when you want these
keys to happen you move these fingers this way. What happens is if



you're used to typing a certain way and you move the keyword a little bit,
it's still okay. When you move the keyword a little bit more and still okay,
but as soon as your hands or your body get into a certain position, all your
speed falls off.

That magic of knowing like, it's called hitting common two tuples and
three tuples they have a another name for those, (xx) but i can't
remember them right now. Words in whatever language you speak have
those very common like in English like 'le' you're going to run into that all
the time right or 'er' you're going to run into that all the time. Or 'ile' and
so those two and three groups of letters your brain understands how to
execute those very quickly. It's called picking and cording, which is similar
to string instruments.

Normally with stringed instruments you hold your cords with your left
hand and you do you're plucking and strumming with your right hand and
you can do kind of the same thing when you design a new keyboard
layout. Some keyboard layouts are optimized for different things. Some
keyboard layouts are optimized for using the home row. Some try and
minimize your pinky usage because it's slower and weaker. Some try and
maximize alternating left and right hands. Some are for developers which
use weird symbols more and so they make these heat maps that you can
use to analyze text that you have created and tell you which particular
layout will have different strong points for what it is that you have typed.
It's pretty neat right. Now, here's the downside. Learning a new keyboard
layout is a mother fucking nightmare.

I'm talking nightmare and so I did some research and discovered that
there's really only like four keyboard layouts worth a shit. QWERTY, which
is what we use now which is pretty tits because it's on every device and
every keyboard and if you ever have to travel and use anyone else's
device god save you if you don't know how to use QWERTY the right way.
It's called that just because that's what the keys here say.

The, there's DVORAK, which is widely regarded to be better, except some
people say that it makes your pinkies quite tired and that's neat because
it's built into Windows you can just activate it and there's a lot of
keyboards that have that built in there. Then the next step past DVORAK
was called COLMAC which focuses on getting the minimum number of
changes from QWERY with a maximum amount of benefit and it reduces
the pinky usage a little bit.

Then there's another one called the "workman" which is more of like a
developer system. Then past that you program around. Now this
keyboard here, it has a computer inside it that allows you to program all
of these keys to do anything you want and then have multiple layers. For
instance there's no function keys so a layer two number five is F-five,
right. Now the downside that people don't tell you about to using a



programmable keyboard is that whatever programming you do on this
board will not carry over to any other board.

If you put your function layers and your cursor keys in a software layer on
your computer, it's much, much more intelligent from my perspective.
Because, now any other keyboard you plug in is going to have those same
shortcuts, macros, layers. Whereas if you only have the stuff you need in a
single board, if that board breaks you're fucked. If you use someone else's
computer you're fucked. If you plug another computer in to yours, you're
fucked.

I much prefer to use a software layer to a hardware layer and then you
know different keyboards that are programmable also have a different
controlling firmware. This keyboard uses what's called a teensy and
there's two common firmwares people use on it was qmk the other ones
tmk and man if you're not a developer. You're in a rough spot. Because
you're really like you got a lot of code.f

You're talking to the hardware you know so I think they're C++ but I'm not
totally sure. Anyway, so what keys might I want to use? I'll show you so
part of the reason that having a little nipple mouse in the middle of your
keyboard is faster if you actually time yourself on tasks is because if you're
doing data entry programming generating content with your fingers every
time you have to move your hand away to somewhere else and move it
back you gotta recenter and then restart to get your cording back. It's the
same with the backspace so on these ergonomic keyboards the first thing
they do is they move your space enter and backspace to your thumbs.

Because, most people only hit the space bar with a single thumb which
leaves one whole thumb which is ten percent of your fingers totally
unused. This thumb is like totally not utilized for most humans - and when
you're doing those fast courting strokes, if you fuck something up which is
pretty common I mean some people have eight percent fuck-ups, you
know I think I have much less but it depends on what words I'm typing
when you come up here to stretch your pinky out to get that back space,
it kills all the pre-programmed stuff that you were gonna execute like
'tatata, tatata' ah fuck and then you're like 'dat.. dat. dat' right. In
software if you hit an interrupt you might have to wait for next cycle, next
whole cycle of timing to like pick back up.

If you're typing and you're like timing it whenever you fuck up if you make
one letter fuck up it costs you, like three letter, right? Because you've got
to do one more entry then one return then re-execution and then your
timings off too. Really cost you like four characters of speed every time
you fuck up one character. What happens is when you've got your your
backspace here your fuck-ups don't cost you as much because you don't
have to recenter. You're already centered. It's pretty cool. This is actually
pretty fucking sweet the like space and enter on the thumbs. Even if i had



a smaller keyboard of which I've got some on order that you build
yourself.


I love the concept of a left thumb back space but now once you get used
to hitting backspace with your left thumb if you're on a normal keyboard
and you fuck up you hit the space a bunch, right? The other thing that
killed me this is called ortho-linear, because the keys are straight on most
keyboards are shifted and shifted is better when you have to pronate your
wrists in this direction but when you've got the ability to put the board
wherever you want, ortho-linear is a little better. Usually on a normal
keyboard i'm hitting be with this hand you have to learn it with this hand.
And then zxcv are shifted. A normal keyboard you're going to come down
with your left finger to hit c and now you can't do that now.

You have to basically learning even on QWERTY, your ZX series or your
zxcv is fucked your b is fucked and then you're fucked on any other
keyboard you go to because of the backspace issue. I didn't realize how
much of a fucking like... I went from like a hundred and ten words a
minute which we'll just call it like a hundred consistently a hundred ten
peak. I went down to like eighty. For instance on a normal keyboard i
know where the guy damn numbers are. This is supposed to be zero. It's
not.

You wouldn't think that you enter numbers that much, but you do and
now so I not only lost the zxcvb this thing I also fuck my numbers up. It
just made me want to switch back and I want to switch back goes slower.
Because of like... don't do this is what I'm saying. It's supposed to be
amazing it's supposed to be awesome. I'm not sure you'll ever make the
profit back. Unless you've got injuries on your wrist right, we'll see how
this goes. Looks very shit to me. I'm gonna go good. I'm being really
specific I'm trying not to make fuck-ups. Doesn't divide your attentions
even though the keyboards are separate. It seems like it would be weird
as fuck but it wasn't that bad. Notice that I'm more accurate on this one
let's split because maybe I'm being a little more conscious like you said.
Even though my keystrokes are slower I actually have the correct less.

That was horrible.

Increasingly digital world

In this increasingly digital world more and more of your time may be spent in
front of a screen, whether that screen is in your phone, or your laptop, or your
desktop computer, you mind as well make that experience as amazing as
possible. If you look at the current numbers regarding how often and for what
percentage of the day people are stuck looking at screens as of 2015. It's
amazingly high.

You should work at the lowest resolution that you're capable of being
comfortable with, because you can see more. At the same time, by definition if
you are comfortable with it, well there's no down side. You only have 5 main



senses, and they're in different orders for many people. Some people are
audiophiles, some videophiles, and some blind or def. or both. It's quite a small
number the number 5. Being that there's so few ways to get data into your
brain, and the most important ones are your eyes and ears, you really should
take the time to optimize those 2 input channels. The investment will pay
dividends for decades, because there is such diminishing returns in the area,
whatever you put into making it great is likely to pay off for a long time. Every
year the technology gets better, and the human becomes the limiting factor.

Cameras get better and better, but the camera can't tell you where to point the
camera and how to compose a good photo yet. Microphones, preamps, and
recording hardware gets better and better, but it can't tell you how to write a
great song or sing it yet. Autotune software can help a little. Amazing speakers
can being great sound to your ears, but they can't close your eyes for you and
get you to imagine the soundstage in front of you, to separate the different
parts of the music in your mind and enjoy each one. The human is becoming
more and more the limiting factor of digital enjoyment with every passing year.

Funny side note. Have you noticed that as cameras get better and better and
nearly ubiquitous, we have decreasing reports of ufo's and big foot? Where
there should be better and better images and recordings of these phenomena,
we have none.

Recliner, 4k monitor, 55inch (prefer inaccurate and curved because the corners
get very hard to see up so close, though for production work, non-curved is
more accurate), mount your monitor / TV high enough and angled down enough
so that your view of it is level when reclined comfortably and able to type and
use the mouse. Software (winsplit revolution) to split screen in 6 so the middle
screen is 1280 pixels wide and you aren't' stuck looking to a side constantly.
Single or dual bottle wine cooler for your delicious beverages, pro mic, studio

Calibration

Calibrate everything

Laser point your speakers, string the distances to ears, check your posture, mark
on the floor where the chair and speakers are, calibrate your stuff and have a
few presets for stuff that's mastered too hot on the top, or too weak on the
bottom. Try with chair in the way, a chair not in the way, make sure to grab
measurements from the general space so you don't over fit the compensation, it
sounds better believe me, single point is pretty bad.

Good acoustics

If you are going to do phone or radio interviews, why not optimize for a good
connection and acoustics? Is not your spoken word and inflection as important
or more so than the banal music so often optimized for?

Nature, empty space

Nature abhors a vacuum

"This idiom is used to express the idea that empty or unfilled spaces are unnatural as
they go against the laws of nature and physics."

From < http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/nature+abhors+a+vacuum.html >

Better little lines on the ground

It's funny the degree to which people will follow directions, even directions that are
just loosely applied. Like if you're in line for an ATM, and there's a little line on the
floor that says where you should stand. Some people don't want to stand so close to
other people, because they don't want them to feel like their ATM PIN is getting
stolen. But then other people want you to shove directly up against the butt of the
person at the ATM, so that you follow the orders of the line that's on the floor.

The question then becomes, which one of these people is wrong, if any? Let's say
there's two or three people there in the queue. It's pretty goddamn obvious who's
next in line. It's not necessary in that environment to suck up so close, but if enough
people show up quickly enough, it could fall apart and people might start trying to
jump the queue.

How do you take advantage of that? If it's true that people just have a natural
tendency to follow suggestions or follow orders, whether they really should or really
need to or not, let's give them some good fucking directions to follow. The point is,
people love to find order and follow directions so much that even when they don't
need to, they will. I'm a proponent for putting better little templates and better little
lines on the ground for the world. R834

Why are churches so space inefficient for putting people under their roofs? Space,
environment

It's amazing how space inefficient giant churches are, if you want to put people inside
them. There's huge cubic feet of space underneath a giant roof and then when you
find out how much of it can contain humans you find out that it's just a tiny amount at
the bottom. So if they had put floors as big as the giant beautiful building they could
fit ten times as many people because it's ten times taller than it needs to be to
provide service to the one little floor at the bottom.

Localize the good

Making the world a better place is far crappier than making your world a better place!

Location

Navigation and deduction

Deduction is really cool that’s why maps only show north. If you know north and you have a
brain you can figure out where south east and west are so you really only need to be right
the at big end you don't need to fill in the rest for an intelligent person that principle applies
to lots of other places like you know if two people are in a room with a cookie and the



cookie gets eaten well if it was eaten by a human and you can see all the humans and the
number of those humans is two it's very likely one of this to people ate the cookie.

Location and friction

That whole "life having the brakes on you starting friction on rolling friction" thing is also
well established by living near the beach or on the beach. Live on the beach, you'r always
there. You live near the beach, you're never there. Why the tiniest bit of difference, it's like
sitting on a seesaw the fucker that's slightly fatter gets all the way down to the ground just

Fighting temptation through habit and environment

If you are faced with temptation, and you have any propensity at all to fall into it, then the
more often that temptation is offered to you, then the more likely you are to fall for it. If
you fall for it once, you're even more likely to fall for it again. Thus you have a couple ways
to fight temptation and find freedom.

Move and / or improve your environment.

If you have a problem with alcohol addiction, and your friends are always inviting you
drinking with them, do you think that makes it more or less likely that you'll have that "just
one drink?" In a perfect and imaginary world, you would just make a decision about what
was best for you in your life, and you would just execute it. Life is far from perfect. Wouldn't
it be great to say, you know what, I’d love some six pack abs, and all around great beach
body, learn a few languages, learn to dance, write a book, travel the world, mind as well get
rich while I’m at it. Let’s throw some true love in there. Why not?

The influence your environment has over you

Proximity is power. What you are around will influence your focus, who you fall in love with,
what jobs you have, what businesses you start. An empowering and enriching environment
makes everything in life easier. Love a certain kind of people? They love you back? Move to
where theres more of them?

Risk managemet through environment

Don't like crime, don't like high taxes? Move! Choose the best place for you! Don't live
and die having never seen this world!

Avoid bad countries

Everyone thinks that the odds don't apply them. They do. Put the odds in your favor, move
to a safe place, or a place with opportunities you like.

In some Arab countries like Qatar: Getting raped, and then going to jail for adultry seems
like a bad deal. Protip avoid fucked up countries.

If you're spending a lot of money on your race equipment you're just finding out how

Sound

Enjoying life

Stereo systems/home entertainment / home theater systems

I've had a 1/4-million-dollar stereo system. I like when people with audiophile
speakers listen to a digital source, then turn it analog in a DAC, then pre-amplify
it and run it through a switcher, then run a cable to another larger amplifier,
amplify the signal again, then it goes through more wires, to some connectors
on the back of a speaker where it usually connects to an analog crossover,
which has parts in it with variable tolerances, and likely changes response based
on heat, and introduces delay into the signal differently on one end and on the
other end, introducing phase problems in the signal represented.

It's quite stupid when you have a digital source to really go analog ever at all if
you don't need to, except for the very last moment that the analog speaker
cones bounce the air around that hits your ears. Every single added step along
the way in between the digital signal and the analog air hitting your ears adds to
the cost, unreliability, difficulty of setup, signal degradation, distortion, and
basically all things that are the opposite of performance.

Ignorance of people

ignorance of trying to show people a world that they choose not to notice.

Enjoy a quality thing

A lot of people are unable to find joy in things. Whereas some people absolutely love
the thing. Take place or keyboards or pens or collecting things. Or cars. The people
who enjoy them and see the detail and the nuance love just sitting in a certain car
because it gives them a feeling of completion and excellence and fulfillment. As a
person that doesn't know what the fuck's going on they just sit there and go okay well
where's the video game controller or whatever. For them, for those people that don't
know what's going on they don't understand the nuance the detail it's almost like
being totally blind to that wavelength.

It's like trying to hear a dog whistle or or just detect something that's outside your
physical ability to detect it. Except in this case the reason that the art is lost on so
many isn't because of physical deficiency of detection it's because of mental



deficiency of trends forming in their mind. The sights and sounds and smells of the
experience in to meanings and so for instance if you wanted kids to actually enjoy
plays which I guess they aren't they aren't tendent to do. You might tell them what it
is about plays that's hard and look this guy's gotta know where to stand. This guy's
gotta know where to stand they gotta see when this thing drops that it doesn't drop
on anybody. That guy sweating to death in that costume but once you add all those
levels of detail they might actually give a shit, they enjoy it or they might still think it's
terrible but at least they had a chance.

Staying safe and keeping your stuff

When you're leaving the house, there's an ever so small statistical probability that you get
robbed while you're out. You should really have wallet, keys and phone, and unless you're

Organizing stuff

Group things so that the smallest useful side faces you. This lets you see the greatest

The reason everyone cares about organization so much is because it literally makes you

them or not. The same goes for ideas if you don't know where to find the idea then you
don't know it. You don't know what you don't remember organization is amazing.

Beauty

Game of millimeters

Beauty is a game of milimeters, and perhaps micrometers, Ever see brad pitt? Ever see his
brother? It's not fair. I think that the number of people out there that are pretty unhappy
with their lot in life in regards to their looks or abilities compared to their siblings is pretty
large. That's the unfairness of the random change that creates greatness. That same
greatness generating chance also generates autism, and death at birth.



Collectors of things seem to serve little ise these days, however imagine a time in the distant
past where say, if you were a weapons collector, and an invading force attacked your land,
now you are an amory. Basically by being collectors of things, you can deploy whatever
single resource you enjoyed over multiple parties. So if 1 gun is good for you, now you can
do one fun for many, sadly some guy has to get that gun that's famous for being unreliable
but pretty.

they're just smiling. Move to wherever those people come from. Wherever they're most
numerous. Then you'll be naturally triggered to be happier and hornier. Hell, I can't see how
getting it the natural way is any worse than paying for a bill for brainwashing yourself.

even charge a slightly higher margin for that single component than you could like having to

If it is true that the most powerful and complicated processes that we are aware of in the world,
are those of living things, then it is very tragic that so much of the data that we could capture from
the rainforests and other places is becoming permanently extinct, because it is robbing us and our
future selves from the learning that could be had from the analysis of so many complicated life
forms. Because we all came from fish anyway, there is a ton of crossover in biological processes
that we would be able to learn from and utilize to make ourselves better, that we won't be able

Work from yourself up, not stuff down, when planning the juice of your live

If you turn upside down the way people look at wealth and success, and look at it from the
person up, instead of the stuff and achievements down, you notice that there's a lot of
chokepoints and factors that are quite hard to overcome, and they're barely affected at all
by the giant levels of wealth and power above them. The human centric upwards view is a
better way to look at things, for if you try to shove 10 lbs of cake in a 5 lb bag, you're not
going to have a good time carrying it home, and if you try to make a person happier by
stacking billions of dollars and meetings on top of him, you'll find that much like the bag, he
doesn't fair as well as if you took his capabilities into consideration before you started
stuffing,

If you are drunk when you're doing all the fun shit, then you are fucking up your memory of

conscious and aware for the best parts of it.

Drugs and chasing changes of consiousness

Some people think these things are good, I do not, and here is why.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument from authority Often when you speak to a drug user,
they portend to have an aura of superiority because they have experienced drugs, and you have
not, therefore they feel that they know things about drugs you do not. This gets boring rather
quickly, for the same reason that using status as evidence, is pretty poor evidence. Your status as
a drug user doesn't lend any credence to the statement that drugs are useful and people should
do them more. Evidence is evidence, bring it forth and leave the aura of superiority at home.

So what are drugs good for? Well, chemicals are the very programming that your brain uses to
cause feelings. If you have this chemical in your brain, you will feel this. If you have this other
chemical instead, you will feel this. So if you ride a roller coaster, and it is exhilarating to you, your
brain will release diazepam. If its terror for you however, your brain will release cortisol. So what
happens if you just take a shortcut, skip the roller coaster ride entirely, and just take the pill that
gets the diazepam into your bloodstream and across the blood brain barrier. When you take
drugs, you often screw up what the emotional programs have in store for you.

If you created a human from scratch, like a science project, you would need some way to program
it to behavior in certain ways and not others, while making sure that it didn't' get suck in loop and
do the same thing over and over again, forget to eat, then die. Nature came up with a great way
to do that, emotions. They're the programming that you were born with, the same programming
that your parents were born with, that without much of it, you wouldn't be here, because you
wouldn't have been born. The desire to eat, but not too much, have sex, but not too much,
breath but not too fast, do one thing but then switch to another thing, find people like you and
team up with them, they are all useful emotional imperatives that allow you to outcompete other



living beings for food and space, and mates. Drugs shortcut this useful programming by giving you
the feelings without the effort that you were supposed to expend to earn them.

The difference between having sex and masturbating, while both result in orgasm is that one is
much more likely to lead to children and continue your lineage, and thus impart whatever habits
and behaviors you have into the future, whereas the person who abstains from sex in favor or the
much easier to get masturbation is more likely to be childless and thus forever removed from the
gene pool.

Well, you've fulfilled one of your emotional imperatives, to experience different states of
consciousness. But you've shortchanged the other part of that program, in that you're often
supposed to execute a certain behavior to earn that chemical from your own brain. Perhaps you
were supposed to win a race, or learn a new thing, or see a beautiful thing, or share an experience
with someone else, to earn that chemical. You however, took the shortcut and took a pill. You
got fulfilled one imperative at the cost of another.

So where do you draw the line between following the good emotional pleasure seeking
programming that you were born with, and taking shortcuts to get the feelings with pills and
inhalants. A great way to follow up and decide what the right ratio of drug use and non-drug use
is this. What performance to most drug users get out of their lives, and at what cost? Are you and
addictive person, would you be the kind of guy that is really curious about how much a drug your
body could handle. Are you in an environment where the drugs that are easiest for you to get just
happen to be the ones that are hardest to have a good relationship with?

I say that if you can do it, it's much better to get your good emotions out of the real world by
fulfilling your good inborn emotional programming, that you are by taking chemical shortcuts.

The shortcuts have lots of downsides outside of their opportunity costs of missing out on real
experience. Take for instance, prison, societal contempt, loss of job opportunities, slippery slope
of wanting to "try" some harder drugs, dependence, addiction, having to associate with dangerous
people who are willing to work with other dangerous people to get you the illegal substances
which you desire. Taking the risk that what you think you bought, you indeed not buy, and what
you got is more dangerous, or will you become a scientist and constantly test everything before
you take it, that sounds like it might kill the buzz, and who know where you could even get such
testing equipment sent to you without getting your name on a list.

Interesting fact, there is a free drug testing service based in Portugal which will test the quality of
your drugs for free as a public health service, and they will accept packages from anywhere in the
world, http://saferparty.ch/

https://dancesafe.org http://www.safernightlife.org/ if you want to know what it feels like,
erowid.com is a good resource

If you think that state change, and being one with the world, and being at peace is so awesome,
you should really check out the great work that the Tibetan monks have been doing over the last
1000 years or so. They are really chill, and really at peace, they can even lower their own body
temperature at will solely through the power of thought. Of course, they don't' invent anything,
and they're getting killed off by the Chinese, and they can't' enforce their own boarders, and they
have no medical progress, and I wouldn't be surprised if their teeth were in pretty bad shape (XX).
But you know, if state change is so great, just let your culture get destroyed peacefully by the




Chinese, focus on the journey outward instead of the journey inward, while the people on the
outside are crushing you.


While you are dicking around trying to feel different feelings, the real world is coming for your
limited resources, they will eat your lunch, and it will not be pretty. Try to fuck around in the
virtual world of games and drugs to the minimum you need to, or know the cost.

Here's Tony's chapter on drugs

People should strive to develop a healthy relationshipjdon't overdose, use the minimum
effective dose, with. Tony thinks it's really important that you see drugs as yet another
chemical that you ingest such as dietary chemicals such as salt, you need some but you also
don't need too much, cause its "immature". See drugs for what they are and what they can
do for you, how they can serve you, educate yourself on their effects. Your relationships on
drugs shouldn't differ from your relationship from any other potential dangerous item.

Richard summary, tony wants you to do drugs, he thinks you can have a good relationship
with them, and will benefit from them, and therefore you should do them, just do them
properly.

Unless you can't manage good relationships with shit, then you shouldn't' do them.

583.It's funny that companies that sell just steroids make bazillions of dollars a year, but
nobody thinks anyone else is on steroids which makes you wonder, if no one is using them,
why are they buying billions of dollars just to not use them.

587.Drugs are an interesting value proposition for the consumer because most products you
buy have to filter through some values before you get the benefit, the feelings. With drugs
get the feelings without the values.

Pearls to swine

Perception, strong as the weakest link

Just as only certain people can see certain colors
And some TVs can show more colors

And some broadcast formats allow those colors to be transmitted
And some cameras allow the colors to be recorded
And some sensors see the colors

And some lights actually emit the right wavelengths of light to be reflected off
the surface to be recorded

And some pigments and paints can reflect that emitted light.

And your glasses, and your eye defects, and your perceptive map

Any break in the chain and you don't get the result

This doesn't just apply to the absorption and retransmission of a beautiful

image, it applies to ideas as well.

Ideas, strong as the weakest link

In order for your audience to appreciate your idea, they need to have the
vocabulary, logic, life experience, similar beliefs and understandings regarding
how the world works to be able to even understand what you are saying.



It's always fun to see someone misunderstand what you are saying so hard, that
they are entirely wrong about it, and not because they understood it in the
correct way, to be incorrect about it in the correct incorrect way, but to just get
it entirely wrong based on a misunderstanding.

You have to choose whether you want to correct the incorrectness they are
stating, which is unrelated to your original point, or you want to skip it and just
attempt to retransmit the original idea, wait for them to understand, and then
have incorrect beliefs as output from the accurately transmitted and
understood idea.


Experience hunting

If you don't encode the awesome things when they happen, you won't be able to recall them very
well. If you're a hunter of experience as one of my friends, who likes to try different drugs and see
how they feel, you might find that you can get much of the same adventure and experience of
feeling new things by changing the beliefs that you have, and changing the go-to instant reaction
feelings that you assign to certain thoughts.

Whether it be working out, making love, or being an honest or good person, if you train and
condition your internal responses to be the one that you want every time you see it, an NLP, it's
called a Swish pattern. It's basically just trying to rewire a behavior that has been rewarded
enough in a positive manner to become a habit.

Altered consciousness

When you're exploring consciousness and feeling, you're doing risky shit blocking up
receptors in your brains with things that you haven't properly qualified as pure. You
don't properly know how you'll respond compared to other people, so you can't really
get your dosages right, and you're not tracking your sleep patterns and whatever
weird biochemical things can be going on inside your body.

Winning the lottery might not be as great as you might have previously thought

For fun, read about anyone that's won the lottery and the horror that comes along
with it and you'll see that one of the worst things that could ever happen to you is
winning a large lottery.

Remove bias and get to experience yourself in a new and exciting way

It's really cool when you forget that you did a thing or you forget that you wrote a
thing. Like for instance, you go through your documents from like 10 years ago if you
have any. You pull out a piece of paper that you wrote when you were a kid, like 15,

20 years ago, and you read it and you're like, goddamn! This is pretty good. I was a
pretty smart fuck when I was 15 or 14 or in love or whatever. It's really neat when you
get to love yourself, not because you forced yourself to, because you thought it was a
good idea or not, or because you were extremely biased because you see so much
profit in loving you.

It's really cool when you love yourself and something that you produced intellectually
and forgot that it was you that created it and then thought "Man, this is awesome.
Who did this?" And then you're like, "I did that. Fuck yeah! How cool am I?" It's the
removal of the bias and the discovery that you are worthy of your own love is really
enjoyable, enlightening, prideful and fun. I just came up with a way, as I say this that



in theory, if you could abstract meaning from something someone did or created as to
keep the overarching theme, however change the contents so wildly that the person
that created it didn't recognize it anymore. Then you can expose them to it, they can
profess their like for it and then you could say, "By the way you actually wrote this. I
just changed this, that and the other. How cool is that?" That could be a really
enlightening, although very hard to structure, gift that you could give a person.
Experiment with ways of eating

You should always try other people's food first so you can get the full flavor of theirs
and then the full flavor of yours.

The miracle of hitting the right temperature on your food. No extra calories, lots
better flavor.

Certain senses affect other senses in ways you wouldn't think they would
Heavier silverware makes food taste better
Sense silverware cup texture

Potato chip bags are noisy because studies show it makes you think chips are
crispier xx

Similar to the chanting from Always Sunny in Philadelphia "worst is first", if you
have to eat a couple things in a row, put the shitty thing first. This way you can
cancel out that shit flavor with all the good ones.

Food tastes better in brighter light
Uncommon permutations and stacking highs

You can stack a sugar high with a coffee high with a good nap with an orgasm,
and whatever else you like. Uncommon permutations can lead to cool stuff.

Balls to not serve balls

Isn't it funny that great restaurants always serve you ox face and goose balls and
throat of tiger and whatever other weird food they can think of. They don't have
the balls to compete on the shit people could legitimately compare. If you order
the tiger balls, how do you know whether they were actually done properly or
not? You have no fucking idea. Because you've never had them before.

Or pigeon face. I don't know what a pigeon face taste like, but if you give me a
cheeseburger, boy I'm going to tell you whether the cheeseburger's better than
another. I think people too easily and too often sacrifice excellence and those
things which we recognize and are most common, because they are the most
delicious. They instead take the easy way out, trying to make weird shit, that no
one likes, taste okay.

Great sex

The silliness and greatness of porn

Imagine monkeys sitting around looking at pictures of each other's butts on the Internet.
That's porn. That is what we are doing.

You'll find more nude pictures and videos on the Internet than you ever could in real life.
There's also a high chance that these people are much hotter and kinkier and greater in
quantity than what you would get. Thus, the fiction can always exceed the reality in some
regards. It doesn't matter who you are, it is a number's game. The amount of cameras
rolling is bountiful. There's also an innumerable amount of beautiful people out there,
getting it on. You can't compete on a looks, kinkiness or quantity measurement. You can win
on the visceral and real experience meter, though.

Hot vs cold, your senses take shortcuts.

It's really hard for your body to know when you're having sex and when you're not. It has to
be able to detect it. It Is similar to how you'll see people freezing to death get delerious and
start taking their clothes off because they think that its hot, or you can put ice on someones
back and if they think they're actually being burnt, they'll respond similar to being burnt.

This is because there's just not that many ways to sense the real world, and your body takes
short cuts. Sometimes it shares channel for the pain signal. Hell some people are even born
with their signals mixed up in the form of synastesia. For this reason the way that you let
your body know that it's having sex right now, and it should feel really great is super
important.

Know what the shortcuts are and activate them

One of the ways your body knows its having sex or not is timing. If something happens, and
then it doesn't happen again for a long while, then its not repetative enough to be sex. You
could call that frequency. Good sex has a frequency to it, any woman will tell you that as
soon as what you're doing is working great, don't change anything until she cums. The
chance that your change is makes it worse instead of better is high, because it was already
great to start with, and the ways to make it feel less great are probably 20 times more
numerous than the few if any greater ways.

How does your body know that its just your underwear rubbing on your fun parts and not
someone you're making love with?

Feel magic moments

These are the magic moments, that you will remember on your death bed. The things that
made life worth living. Your first love, the birth of your child, achieving that lifelong dream,
sharing great food and sights with friends and loved ones.

Photography

If you aren't in the photo, your photo probably sucks.

Other people with better cameras, ladders, drones, more time to wait for better lighting and more
unique and interesting circumstances have probably already taken, and likely will take in the
future a better photo of whatever you're shooting, so unless there's something actually unique,
you might not want to waste your time doing what everyone else is already doing better for free.



Also, even if you take a good photo, say of your visit to see the Mona Lisa, every year a new
amazing better sensor comes out which does the job of digitizing that art better than you could,
regardless of how much money you spent, for the march of technology upwards continues. Just as
there's depreciating value of knowledge, there's often depreciating value of imaging.

You'll have to watch your loved ones die. (so you prefer they watch you?)

You'll live forever in a terrible state, (longevity requires robustness.)

More people make more progress faster. I'm glad my parents didn't decide the world

still alive and productive would be nice. You're literally asking for others to die out of
your fear. The burden should be higher. Have courage. If living longer sucks, we'll

know how to make one faster than 1 year per year? And that's if you added 120 years
to a 100 year old person starting TODAY.

P.S. Curing aging isn't immortality. You die at 600 on average by accident, and if the

Understanding, visualizing

You can visualize getting older and not dying like a chain, except each link in the chain is a
different thing

Let's say that you want to pull a shopping cart with what's in your McDonald's bag. You tie
some french fires to each xx this analogy needs to use things people understand in their day
to day lives, and each one is different, and they're flimsy. So a normal chain is a bad
analogy, because each link is too similar. For this analogy to work we need a bunch of
different things as links, and as soon as one breaks, you die. So the act of getting really,
really old and not dying is basically being a chain where every single link stretches to its
breaking point at the same time. You die earlier if one link gets stronger while the other
gets weaker, then the weaker one amplifies the rate it fails at. You can also get it without
one getting stronger, it just helps the weak one to fail faster when its surrounded by other
strong ones, because increases the rate it must stretch at, for nothing else is stretching to
absorb force. Thus the analogy is great, but the chain needs to be made of different
systems (circulatory, breathing, mental, etc.) instead of nearly identical systems.

then the failure of old age.) Patrick Swayze, you see the heartthrob turn into a vegetable, it's
not great. I'd be happy to find any other examples which actually inspire people to fight the
damn obvious and necessary fight, instead of waiting until it's too late.*

If the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation sticks around for long enough, its going to need to
resave the lives of all the young African's it saved.

Make 'em care
Intro

Imagine you stopped aging right this minute, and your body was locked in time age wise.
Now you're offered to choose how many years you want to live at that age, and you'll die
the moment you hit the target you write. You're also given 20 free passes to hand out to
anyone you wish to give them the same chance. The catch is, you must write it down within
the next one minute, or you will be drop dead on the spot. What do you write?

Know your enemy

If you look above you in your family tree, you will see that 8 out of all the 10 people
above you that are no longer alive, are likely to have been killed by the same two
things, cancer and heart disease. Guess what this means for you? It means you have
about an 80 percent chance of dying of a heart attack or cancer as well. Is it wise of
you to hope that someone else saves your life? Should you leave your fate and the
fate of your loved ones and offspring to the chance that someone else works to cure
for that which is definitely coming to steal away all that is important to you.

The days of living with our heads in the sand, and hoping that someone else cures our
ailments for us is over. It is time now to take our own destinies in our own hands and
mold our futures in that that which we are worthy of.

The grim reaper's got his scythe in hand, he's coming for you. He's coming to chop
your head off, and the heads of everyone you loved, and all your offspring. He's
coming to kill all of you, and he's going to get you. The more you fuck around with this
silliness of accepting the values of long dead people, who lost the game, the more
likely you are to accept their fate. They left a book that is poorly written. They left a
book that I'm not really sure why it's a classic. There's got to be something better than
this.

Towards life

Giving nothing to the future




When you diet and exercise, you only help yourself, nothing you're doing there is
helping anyone else. When you build medical technology you not only help yourself,
you help all the humans that will ever exist in the future.

Meat first

If you focus on the problems of today, you earn the right to solve the problems of
tomorrow. Futurism is more harm than good. Nanobots are garbage. We already have
a godlike nanobot called the white blood cell. Reprogramming it will outperform
"real" nanobots for the next 100 years
Live longer, fuck more

If you had a longer life, you'd sure be able to fuck some things up and make it alright
in the end.

What would a generous god give his children?

If you were a god, and could improve human lives in any way you could dream, what
might you do? Well first of all you could stop death from aging, no reason to have
these nice people that we've worked so hard to create rotting away from birth on
their way to a quite often and painful disappearance. This planet that we live on is the
only one we know of in the entire universe that has the spark of consciousness on it.
The flame is worth carrying on.

The topic of aging is not popular

I volunteered to help create a video for the SENS Foundation founded by Aubrey Gray. He
was a tall guy with such a long beard, almost to the floor. He used to say that there are two
reasons he keeps doing this work, the first is that no one wants to hear about the problems
of aging people, and second is his wife. His wife is some kind of a biologist; I cannot
remember what her specialization is. She is much older than he is, maybe, about 20 years
older than he is. She already lost some teeth, and when I met her I could not believe she
was Aubrey's wife, I thought she was just one of the employees there.

Longevity strategy at the family level

Just think about it, use logic. If you care about your family survival, which you obviously do,
and you would choose to implement a strategy at the family level. Would you divide your
family in halves and send one half to live on another side of the world and leave the rest
here? Just because, well, if one half dies, the other one gets to live. But you don't see
anyone doing this shit, because it sucks. You would rather take the risk, have the entire
family living close by and enjoy the time you have with your loved ones. The idea of dividing
my family, my friends or the entire humanity and sending half of them to live somewhere on
another planet just because we don't want to focus on one specific issue sucks.

Hence, if I am not happy doing it on the family level, I am not happy doing it at all. For
example, I am not so happy to die earlier because we want to move to another planet. Fuck
that. So I wish Elon had done a little bit differently there, but he’s a massive fucking hero.

We need more of those. We need more of those dudes. He thought it was going to fail. He’s
like, "Yeah, man. I thought SpaceX would totally - going to fail." But it’s so important that
someone had to try it. Hero! Clap! Fuck. Amazing, right?

SCI.27

Improving focus in health

I think we are fucked up, and we don't need to be fucked up. We can focus on shit that's
better. We can make improvement. We can reallocate funding. I'm going to give you a trivia
question that everyone fails. Everybody. I think I may have got one person that was close.



Ever. Maybe two that answered this question properly. Prepare to answer incorrectly. Have
you heard of cancer? Kills a lot of people.

I will tell you as an axiom that you can use to answer this that 40% of people die from
cancer. The other 40% was really an extra 60%. If we got 100%, 40% die from cancer,
another 40% die from heart disease, which is basically heart attacks. That's 80%. When you
see people researching cancer or heart disease, they're kind of making the good decision, in
that those two things kill the shit out of everybody, and everything else is like nothing, in
comparison. Everything else fits in a 10% window. Well, that's pretty interesting.

SCI.28

Away from death

We focus on trivial things too often

You can almost look at life as war because the conflict thing as preprogrammed in our
brains to refine our focus, and our focus needs refining. I'm here in a book store
looking at magazines when I look at the ones that are going to help me fight the battle
against the guy that coming to kill me(Mr. cancer or Mr. heart disease) There really
are not any. I mean maybe there's a business magazine that helps me invest in a
company that MAYBE ends up curing what the hell I was going to have a problem
with. The vast majority of these other things are just quality of life hacks, and we are
well into diminishing returns of the quality of life.

Visualize how important every day is, how few you have.

http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
Fear of loss (greed)

Look. Look at these people. If that was something that was looked up to. And to tell
you the truth, other than making the money from it, I don't really know how to hype it
as something that's accurate. Unless you could personalize it to your family, like, "Hey,
do you want to like I don't think -1 think all my grandparents are dead. Yep. Yeah, all
my grandparents are dead. How awesome is that for me? It's not that awesome. If I
want to call my grandpa right now, he's fucking dead. Can't call him. Nice guy, smart
guy. Nice to talk to you. Dead. Did I do anything to help him at all? A single fucking
thing? No. Watched him die. Played video games for 10 years. Okay, could I have done
something? Yeah, probably could've done something. Well, do you want to maybe do
something before your dad dies? Would that work for you? Or how about you? Would
you do it for yourself?

When does a person really die?

The dream of being able to capture your own destiny and use science and progress to
capture your own personal fucking power and well-being, it just dies with a whimper.
That's fucking sad, common and usual, and a fucking tragedy. How many people are
sitting at old folk's homes right now that no one cares about? That sucks. There was a
time when those people had meaning. There was a time when those people had
opportunity, power, vibrancy and life and attractiveness. When did they really die? Is
it when our heart stops? The brain stops? Or when they could stop caring? Or when
we stop caring?

When does the person actually die?

Steve jobs failed

Don't be so busy with today, that you lose tomorrow.

He died from the exact same thing that his father died from, and died eleven years
younger than his father was, and if you didn't know exactly what killed your father



would be likely to kill you then you've been living in the land of diversion and he
fought the hardest that he could at the end to try and survive, and he failed. Because
you can't shove twenty years of research and progress into the last three months of
your life.

SC2.1

You are crushing Steve jobs

I always come to the question of dead Steve jobs. Respected by many, if you are
reading this book right now, you kicked his ass. The decisions you made were
better than the decisions he made. He is the loser and you are the winner. You
would not trade places with him if offered the chance. In the old days if you
tried to find the fountain of youth, you would be thought mad, and likely you
might be. The world we live in today has in the technical world very little to do
with the world our emotions evolved in.

Die like Steve Jobs

I think it might be quite useful to coin the term "Die like Steve Jobs" DLSJ,
because it really pins the point on "you could be the most successful or
technical smartest dude around and then die from some boring bullshit because
the tech didn't exist to save you.

R78

Shock them by showing the absurity of the status quo

I found a way to give my kid cancer and a heart attack it just takes a little while to kick
in; and I figure there's chance of kicking in this year and then it keeps getting stronger
and stronger and stronger as times goes on until when he's around.

Moral participation & responsibility. The fine line between curing & promoting

How similar is not saving to killing, how similar is not curing to promoting? If you have
Jon Stewart doing nothing, saying nothing politically, it turns out that in order to be a
cool political party, you need attractive good shit to do with co-habitants of that party.
Thus, you kind of need fun interesting humorous things to do. You could say Jon was
like a mascot. ! Xx Idea needs more explaining!

Moral participation & responsibility, Intention fallacy

I think it's a fallacy that humans look for intention and human motivation or action,
which is the reason they have such a hard time understanding the similarity between
not doing and doing. If you see a man choking to death on the street, just walk on by
and the man dies - to a certain degree you are responsible. It's our constant linear
forward progression through time that makes it hard for us to see. Here in this world
there's a dead guy and there in that world there's not a dead guy. The difference
between the dead guy and not dead guy is your action. I think that the person doing
the action is some other conscious actor that we have to manipulate, and we don't
want people to get used to us doing the right thing and expect it.

Take responsibility, no one else is going to do it

If you think someone else is going to solve it, and you're overly positive, you don't do
anything. If you're overly negative, you think it's unsolvable, you don't do anything. Or
you stop being a fucking pussy and you do something about it. You write a book about
it. You put an ad in an in-flight magazine. You do some goddamn talk shows. You
volunteer to do video, which I did a long time ago. Whatever.



You do something, right? And we are at the time now where we do not have to
pretend that there's nothing that can be done. There are things that can be done, and
as Peter Thiel just said, they're underfunded. No one cares about them. Fuck, poor
Aubrey de Grey has been giving talks on TED and at Google, and no one believes.
They're just like, "Eh, crazy guy. Death is cool." Like, every time I bring up this concept
that people should live longer, oh my God. You don't understand.

SCI.39

Make the feel responsible. Inaction is an action.

"He's got like a 15% chance every year of having one of these two things but that's
really just what aging is, except that you didn't cause it and therefore people don't feel
responsible for it, but that's the only way to shock them into understanding that not
caring is similar to causing."

Dying with a whimper not a bang.

My grandparents all died. I did nothing to help them. My parents will die soonish, and
I've done little to help them survive. I'd rather work on helping my family and loved
ones survive with medical tech, than spend time fiddling with A.I., space travel, It's
fun to dream about the stars while you're sinking into the quicksand.

Death vs pain and discomfort

I don't really care about death so much, however, pain and discomfort, I surely do,
and I really care about doing the best I can do.

Getting old sucks

Ever notice that constant look of horror some quite old people have? Maybe it's just
the way gravity affects the very old, or maybe getting old sucks terribly

The inevitable day you will need help

If you're able to afford the interventions when they come, then what you need to do
is pray, beg, try, preach, pay and lobby, and hope that these things are there when
you need them. You will need them. You, personally, will need help. There will be a
day when your body decides it doesn't want to play anymore. You are not going to like
that day. Or even worse, you die with a whimper and not a bang. Your testosterone
diminishes and you just - you start to care less about things, it's harder to make
friends, your social circle gets smaller, you end up in a home somewhere, forgotten
about.

Media

Marketing Video for ending aging

So I had this idea 19.06.2016 in the morning while I was waiting for a date. I thought it
might be kinda powerful to make like videos about really old people basically dying or
having any of the diseases of old age.

You interview them and ask them questions like "How do you feel about dying and
death? If you'd have a choice, would you want to live longer?"

I was watching a video where a US Air Force Captain, a pilot, got ejected out of a F-15
moving at super-sonic speed (~800mph). And the force of the wind almost tore off his
limbs. He was floating on the ocean, over which he had flown. Hanging on to a little
raft for dear life, thinking "This is it, I'm going to die."



But his determination to not leaving his family, wife and kids, in trouble - living a life
without him - propelled him to fight for his survival.

Why then, would we not have that same feeling on our death beds. Why do we need
to accept that inevitable destiny.

I was talking to a lawyer chick this morning, the date that I was waiting for. She made
me think about that inevitability. When I told her that I'd pursue ending aging if I had
unlimited funding (which is a question she put to me once I told her I wanted to be
rich) - she said "Well, if that's what you want to do with the limited time we have
here". Now, to me, ending aging is pretty worth while goal and acceptable use of my
limited time here.

I think that the perception that we don't have a choice, we all die, can be changed. We
can fight it. If we show people what the other people who are dying, how they feel.
And if, I mean maybe they don't want to delay the inevitable, but if they do. If we can
get them to open up about how scary death is and how they don't want to die, even
by "natural" means (aging).

Then maybe, we can change people's view about the inevitablity of dying of aging.

Selling life

Make em care

I'm good with this section including all the tips and tricks for overcoming people's
hypnosis and bias. 1. They need to be able to sell this shit on their own, because viral
is good. 2. While teaching them how to beat other people's silly ideas and habits, you
side step them digging in their heals if they were the ones that had the stupid ideas.
That way they don't have to save face and try to argue in their mind against the idea
that you are trying to sell.

At what point do you just figure that out that there's something that could actually be
done here. Then, how do you get other people to give a fuck? I think that art of
capturing the moment when someone, who really dies, wishes he could show a
dancer dancing, and then, now they just can't dance anymore. I think actually the
SENS {Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence Research Foundation ) people
might've just put that up on their website. Something similar to that. I didn't look at it
that much, but there's like a finite number of tropes. Are you familiar with the term?

Hello, Thanks for reaching out. The current low hanging fruit in longevity
technology is the marketing and outreach. For the same reason that Bill Gates
and others offer matching funds, convincing others to do the right thing has
good force multiplication. The scope of keeping humans robust enough to



survive damage and improve is so wide that it might be the hardest problem
we've ever faced.

Which is great, because human consciousness is the most rare and
valuable commodity in the universe, especially yours and mine, so the
expected value of the trade is quite good, even if its a hard task.

Directly attacking the pro death mindset that so many people have has
been proven unfruitful by anyone that's tried it recently, thus I suggest a
more sex drugs and rock and roll approach. Give them the hedonism
they want, and should want, and then pivot into the correct actions
intelligent emotionally fulfilled people tend to desire. In this case,
rejuvenation technology.

The first step to scale is to convince people their own lives are worth
saving, and they can be saved. Skipping the outreach and directly
funding research (as Sens does with the Buck Institute for instance) isn't
as good an idea, for SENS takes in less than a few million a year, and the
potential for investment in the space is several orders of magnitude
larger. Their pitch just doesn't seem to resonate, so it's time for a better
pitch :)

I think that a persons donations should both feel great giving, and have a
real world measurable effect that is significant. Thus no 2 people's
donation has the same meaning to them. Would you like to take a look at
the book as it currently exists, and then see if it helps you choose a path?

Hide your desire to live, or just come out with it and hear lots of shit about it from the
malinformed

I don't want to do that shady bullshit where I've got an agenda, but I don't want
to really talk about it. I'm not really comfortable doing that. I guess if I got to live
a couple years longer, it'd be worth it, but I hope that I could get the job done
just being straight up and tell people Yeah, living longer would be cool. For some
reason, you're fucking hypnotized to think it would be terrible, and if you lived a
couple years longer, the whole fucking world would explode, but it would
actually be alright, awnd if it ever wasn't alright, it turns out there's a lot of
buildings you could jump off. Just try not to land on anybody.

This is a lot like atheism, if you're truthful about it, depending on where you live,
and your circumstances, they might kill you. For instance, if you were a muslim,
and then you say there's no god, yeah, the death penalty is prescribed.

Being a Scivivor should pay you enough profit to eat the slings and arrows of
outrageous idiots in most places.

Transportation

Look Both Ways

Sitting in the back of a plane is lOx safer than sitting in the front

Or you could have a more [inaudible 45:33.2] car. Or you could check out the local laws on
what type of lights you can have on your car. What [inaudible 45:37.8], what brightness can
they blink. You can change the streets you drive on. You can change your orientation on the
car. You could have a driver. You could sit in the back. You could even reverse your seat.
Turns out that sitting backwards in an airplane, 10 times safer than sitting frontwards. Yeah,
literally.

Drive the safest car, at the safest times, on the safest roads, to the safest places, or better
yet, just already be there, (cut out transitions)

Emergencies

Getting people to calling 911

You hear these stories about terrible things happening to people and no one ever
even calls 911 because they felt someone else was going to do it; and you learn the
way to overcome that, is to look at a single person and point directly at them and say,
"You. You call 911 now. You." And make sure that they understand.

It's funny when you learn these tricks like if you're getting raped don't yell rape, yell
fire because people are more likely to come. What a fucking weird world we live in.
The reason I mention this is I'm basically in that same game. Death is coming for you,
it's coming for everyone that you love and I've got to be the guy to yell fire not death.
I've got to be the guy that points directly at you through my book, through my word,
directly in your face and tell you that you need to save your own life.

R352 & QW.352









Distance is the best defence

Some people's preprogrammed responses to interactions are better and worse, right? I
visualize a punch coming at me, I want to duck it and hit. I want to strike. That's my natural
response to when I see a punch coming. If I'm carrying a weapon and I see some other dude
pull up, I want to pull my weapon, right? In certain environments that's good, in certain
environments that's bad. If you're out gunned and there are ten of them and there's one of
you maybe you shouldn't draw. If you're up against a dude that's a martial artist ten times
better than you or he's gotten more guys with him or you're drunk maybe you should get
the fuck out of there.

Your preprogrammed responses need to exist because there's so much profit in acting
quickly in so many situations. However, the sooner that you can make sure that you're
accurately applying the correct one or you have a board enough range of quick responses
that you're more likely to execute the quick one. This isn't just something that happens
these are violent and ultimately rare; and if you run your fucking life properly so rare as to
never exist situations. I chose to live in the safest place in the world. I had enough of that
pulling guns on people bullshit. I had enough of that violent lifestyle; getting jumped, mace,
guns and all that shit. I had enough of that. There's no profit in it. I chose to live some place
that didn't exist for those people that weren't lucky enough or smart enough to get the fuck
out they still have to play that game.

Positional awareness

Be near the exit, and know where all the exits are.

If you smell smoke, get the fuck out then tell someone. Don't tell people until you know it
won't limit your and loved ones abiliity to escape.

Night club fires happen, and they're horrible.

It's very hard to shoot a moving target, so consider running instead of complying with
demands at a distance.

Sit with your back to a wall so you can see what bullshit is coming in the door.

Avoid large groups of men.

Avoid situations known to get out of hand.

There are no spectators in a riot.

Your team

Share your location with friends before you go out

If you split up, declare what you'll each do in case you can't find each other at the time
you agree to meet back up
Don't be in shit neighborhoods

Realize that bad things happen to everyone, no one is immune to the probabilities
Your cell phone might have an option that under durress it will contact people you list.
Beware answering the door

If people come to your house asking if you have an alarm, the answer is always yes.

Perhaps you shouldn't be answering the door at all really. If you don't answer your
door you can't be served a subpoena, or punched in the face.

Wearing body armor sucks

You ever worn body armor? Do you know how hot a body armor is? You'll sweat to death.
It's fucking hot under a body armor dude. My point is, there are some things in life that are
faster than thought and need to be faster than thought and those things you should train.
And, what's better than training is controlling your own environment. You don't need to be



in those places where those shits happen. Anyway, that's not the important part. Everybody
knows training exists, that's great. What I want to share with you is that there are some
things that you can train and there are some things that you can't; and you kind of want to
know the difference.

Understanding the enemy

People that want you to die

Pro death bullshit

Summary of pro death arguments re: longevity progress
Fairness

Only rich people will get it. (no tech has ever done this.)

Better to give money to the poor than science, (family, city, state, nation, has
proven local investment beats foreign.)

Bad for society

Dead people make more room for new, other people, (consider going first.)

Run out of resources (live people discover/extract/renew better than dead or
nonexistent)

Overpopulation (colonize the seas, solar system, or have a war.)

Stop having kids

Worse wars (nukes are more dangerous than having your first 220 year old person
in 2136)

Dictators never die (they die all the time and rarely of age)

Old people are expensive (50% of your lifetime medical cost occur in your final year.
Delay is profitable.)

Old people suck, (death is an inferior cure to robustness.)

Bad for individual

You’ll get bored, (your memory isn’t that good, or your boredom isn’t age related)
You’ll have to watch your loved ones die. (so you prefer they watch you?)

You’ll live forever in a terrible state, (longevity requires robustness.)

Against gods will (not if he disallows suicide, then it is required.)

People will force you to live forever

Do you think less people make progress faster? What’s your target level of
depriving life of existence? How do you plan to keep mankind robust from
extinction events on a single planet? You might just need more people. What do
you think our technology would look like if we had lOx less people for the last
100 years?

A complete and honest representation of people's concerns is beneficial to all
parties. Please add to or correct the list where you see fit.

More people make more progress faster. I'm glad my parents didn't decide the world
would be prettier or work better without me in it. Einstein, Bell, Tesla, Da Vinci etc,
still alive and productive would be nice. You're literally asking for others to die out of
your fear. The burden should be higher. Have courage. If living longer sucks, we'll
know 100 years from now, and decide then. First 220 year old in 2136 unless you
know how to make one faster than 1 year per year?



Man up, save your family, save yourself.


P.S. Curing aging isn't immortality. You die at 600 on average by accident, and if the
parade of imaginary horribles comes true, even earlier.

Health spending measures the consumption of health care goods and services, including personal health
care (curative care, rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and medical goods) and collective services
(prevention and public health services as well as health administration), but excluding spending on investments.

Shown is total health expenditure (financed by public and private sources).

Tithonous error

The reason no cares about medical research now is because they figure that life
will just gradually suck before they die that they'll be happy to die. And that
would be the same thing as trying to convince yourself, "Oh, you know, I want
to defeat this other nation, how can we do it?" Well, we can beg them to kill
us... We can get them to beg us to kill them. Well, that doesn't make any sense,
why would they beg you to kill them. Oh, because we'll hurt them so badly and
make their life suck so much that the onset of death will be like a favor to them.
If you fall for the trick that life can just make your life suck so much that then
you don't care about living anymore, man. That's pretty fucking, pretty short
sighted of you.

Energy theory of aging














Look up the energy theory of aging, Xx have to find it on Hacker News. The theory
basically states that the more you eat, and the faster you operate, the more damage
you accumulate as a function of metabolism. I think there's some problems with it,
because whales seem to do pretty well for the GIGANTIC amount of food that they
eat. I also did see an exhibit at the xx "welcome?" museum of health technology in
London that there's actually a relationship between longevity and heart rate that was
discovered. More at: https://news.vcombinator.com/item?id=10788503
Fighting the good fight

We should focus on what matters

If I had the comedians working on pitches for why working on bio it would be better than
my first attempt on this which is here: Lots of people if their car don't start in the morning
they know how to fix it....but if their heart doesn't start they're out of luck. We need more
people repairmen.

Time the breakthroughs to appear when you need them

Thus, if you're in your 30's, then you should want lots and lots of more research, even at the
cost of application, so that the maximum payoff from their efforts kicks in right when your
health is going to shit. If however you're already in pretty poor health right now, you may be
happier with getting a better doctor or facility more properly diagnosing, administering and
tracking application of the current state of the art to you.

You must act early

You can't shove twenty years of research and progress into the last three months of your
life.

I happily declare that I would love to see medicine kicking maximum ass when I need it. In
the meantime, I'll try to keep out of the path of runaway trains and angry alligators.

Peter Thiel's three attitudes towards death

And that's something that I want to address because I think that - Peter Thiel says you
got three options. You can accept it, "Eh, you know, I'm going to die. There's nothing I
can do about it so I'm just going to accept it." There's option two. You could care. But
think that caring doesn't matter because it's too hard. "Yeah, you know, I care. Dying
sucks, but it's too hard to work on, so I'm not going to fuck with it." Then there's
option three, which is fight. He chooses option three. Well, it's a good way of looking
at it.

The Breakthrough

How valuable is your future?

If your future is important enough to save for, its important enough to be around for. If your
future is worth saving for, it's worth Sciviving for.

Saving for the future- The breakthrough






Do you save money? Do you have a savings account? Okay. I assume you're saving for the
future so that at some day in the future, you can have more money. Safety. Okay. I would
say that that's a very common behavior. I would say that's a positive behavior. Reduces the
volatility in one's finances. It's important. I would also say that if you could put 10% of your
money away for savings, at least every single good personal finance guide suggests. 10% is
like the most common number that you'll [inaudible 32:24.4],

SCI.34

I'm going to say that you should be putting some money aside to be alive to spend that
money. If you're going to plan for the future financially, you might as well for you being alive
financially as well. Because it turns out that dying is probably more common than going
broke. Like, the chance that you will die is a lot more likely than the chance that you'll go
bankrupt. But no one's... well, there are two versions to that, right? One, if some technology
hits, you got to be able to afford it. You fund it to the degree that you exclude yourself from
using it, as if you donate so much money to research that you can't afford the damn
outcome of the research, that's probably a stupid decision.

SCI.35

Getting rich on health

If you have a choice to buy a stock in a company that heals people instead of hurts them like
weapons vs bio tech, biotech wins because there's never been less war and there has never
been more people. The biotech sector is going to outperform the weapons sector.

Fund The Future

Setting aside 10%

If you can

If you can put away 10 percent of your income for the future spending, you can surely
put 10 percent away for your being alive to spend it! Invest in your future, your real
living future, not just your financial future!

How many could comfortably contribute 10%?- Health span

Now, how many people could comfortably take out 10% of the money they make?
Now, mind you, this question is a little fucked up because we’re focusing on the 90%
that don't matter. But you know what? The 90% that don't matter is still worth a lot of
millions of dollars. That's fine, okay? Elon Musk was only worth maybe 100 or 200 to
each one of his businesses. If you can get 100 or 200 any other way, it's just as good.
You're not just as good, but real fucking good, right? You could hire a CEO for like
$150k that does 70% the job Elon does, and you're still doing great.

Putting a little aside for survival

If you can put 10% of your money away for savings, you can cut that shit in half and
put 5% of it away for fucking survival, and join the 5% club that believes in the future



through science, okay? And not the faggot-y way that these other guys are doing it,
okay? Let me tell you: I'm not the first guy to think technology exists. There's people
that are called technologists, and what are they known for doing?

Nothing. There's a group of people called futurists. What are they known for doing?
Not a fucking thing. What do futures fund? Jack shit. Well, why do I want to be a
futurist? The fuck is a futurist? It's a stupid term. Like, yeah, the future is a thing, so
what? Why do I want to understand the future? What am I like? A sci-fi author? Like, I
don't - what the fuck? I don't identify as a futurist.

SCI.Ill

What do we need?

I need more human beings doing more intelligent things that benefit people like me. I
need more people acting in their own best interest. I need more people to understand
what their own best interests are, which means I need less complacency, less
cowardice, and more correct, heroic, honorable action. If you want to become a
scientist and you want to get into biology and bio tech, fucking great. If you've got
money and you're saving your money for the future but you're not saving your health
for the future, you're fucking up.

If you're putting 10% of your money away so it exists when you're dead, you may
want to change your ratios up a little bit and maybe put 5% of your money away, and
put 5% into being alive to fucking spend it. And I've never heard of anyone ever say
those words. And I only came up with them, and I've been preaching the same shit for
a long time. I only came up with that like a couple days ago. I was really happy about
it. I was like, "Eh, that's a good fucking idea."

SCI.63

Putting away 10%- Health span

The counter-example sucks. I'm not going to mention the counter-example. I believe
that the concept of putting away 10% of your earnings is a commonly used number
for two things: personal finance and tithing. What's tithing? Well, that's where you
give money to your religion. Well, how much do you give? 10%, obviously. Alright,
who does that shit? Like Mormons, scientologists, and probably a fuck ton of other
people. Okay. Well, how'd they arrive at 10%? I don't fucking know, but they probably
figured that out in the last 100 or 200 or thousand years, so let's just go with that
number.

Science and Technology

If you believe that science and technology can resolve most human sufferings, and if
you believe that science and technology are mandatory components of our species'
survival, so we will not get extinct like 99.8 or more percent of everything that has
ever existed on this planet. It is worth believing in my theory core. There are much
more stupid and shitty things in the world that people consider to be their values.

They believe in certain social systems that have different names: Marxism,
communism and Christianity. These isms and itys are certain belief systems which can
do good and evil. I'd like to say that understanding them has its benefits, even more
they produce some good lessons that we could learn.

Getting people to invest in Longevity

My point is that that's of why Bitcoin's good. There's a lot of other reasons why
bitcoin's good. Getting people to donate 5% of their savings for longevity research
should get you into a member of a club where you get discounts other people don't
get. Why not? Why the fuck not? It's free for the companies, right? So I just registered
these domain names with bitcoin, and I registered them there, why? Because
[inaudible 105:44.9] the bitcoin. Did I have to? No. But I wanted to support the fucking
ecosystem. Right? And it's faster, easier. I don't have to worry about declining because
we're [inaudible 105:57.3] bullshit.

SCI.105 & QW.SCI.105

Getting People to invest in Longevity

The guys that started the longevity movement, they had something called The 300
Club. And so The 300 Club was like, "Look. We need some goddamn money. Give us
some goddamn money. We're a pretty good name in this club. You'll be a member of
the 300 people that tried to fucking do something. You'll go down in history as
important." I can't name any I want to list. And I can't remember how much money
they gave, or whatever. But it just seemed to me like something that wasn't
compelling enough. Like, artificially limiting that number to 300, it didn't work. I got to
become a member of it. And it might've cost like $12,000 or something. It wasn't -
that's just, like, off the top of my head. You can look it up. It's called The 300 Club.

SCI.94 & QW.SC1.94

Getting People to invest in longevity discount club

I need education reform -1 didn't tell you about the - remind me to tell you about the
education reform. It's short and awesome. So... the 300. Oh. There is a discount club
that they have marketed very well. I might be able to differentiate enough for it to not
matter. Like I was thinking... so the reason cryptocurrency isn't working is because -
I'm just going to talk fast. Is it okay if I talk fast? I don't sound as cool, but whatever
the fuck. You'll run out of attention span at some point anyway.

SCI.98 & QW.SC1.98

Discounts for Longevity

No one's doing it. It should get fixed, okay? And so that same concept of "what's the
other way to do it? What's the other way to fix it?" is to give [inaudible 103:17.6]
people buy. But what could you give them? A discount. Well, what are you going to
give them? 1%? I have an idea. Fuck you. You have more than 1% margin, don't you?
You're selling products. You're working at 40%, 30%, 80% margin, depending on the
shit you're selling, right? So how about fuck your 1%, why don't you give them a 10%
discount? Everybody does that. Everybody has coupons. Everyone has discount days.
Everyone has prices that float around and change. So it makes it interesting to actually
keep track of what your prices are so they may actually want to buy some shit from
you.

SCI.102

When you get a merchant account, there's actually a rolling reserve. And you end up
having 5% of your gross sales for the last six months sitting in their bank account. And
if you're only working at a 10% margin, it literally means that half of all the profit you
make is sitting in their bank account. No one realizes that shit because they've never
billed a credit card. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Maybe that's why Stripe's got such good
market penetration. That's great, man. Yeah. Well, if you google "rolling reserve," you



can read all about it. It's a thing. I don't know how Stripe's working around that.

Maybe it triggers at certain limits, or maybe they got so much funding they don't give
a fuck, or maybe they've got good fraud detection with their merchants, or... I'm not
sure what they're doing about it, but I didn't invent the term of rolling reserve, and
I've lost a lot of money to them, so like, I know how shitty they are.

SCI.108

Long story short, there could be a way - a discount costs a company nothing to give.
Nothing. It doesn't cost a company a fucking thing to give a discount. Unless the
discounts are being used by their existing clientele only. Okay? So if you're using
discounts to attract new business, that doesn't cost you shit. If you're using discounts
and the only people using them are your existing clients, then you're just sacrificing
margin, assuming that they were going to stay with you anyway, which isn't always
the case. It is a competitive world. Prices tend to trend downwards due to
competition, and increases efficiency. Mostly competition.

SCI.109

My point is, you could promote bitcoin or any social endeavor with a membership tied
to a discount. And by the way, this is [inaudible 109:48.0], Who else does this? Oh, I
don't know, the AAA? The AARP? The NRA? There's a lot of people that group and
gather discounts. Hell, Mensa gets discounts. When you join Mensa, you get a
membership card and you can get discounts on Hertz Car Rentals and other shit. What
does it cost these companies to do that? Nothing. It's even good marketing, right? I'd
like to see that. I'd like to see a 5% club. Now look, I haven't put a lot of thought into
this, but these feel like they're going to work. I'm going to speak as I'm passionate
about these things, even though I haven't put that much thought into them.

SCI.110

Like, if you pay with Bitcoin, you get your fucking product. If you pay with credit card,
you might not get your product? Why? Because they don't trust you. Oh, another
funny thing: people that have - I've run a lot of money through credit cards, okay? A
lot. People think that when you get advertised, like a 2.9% discount rate, that if you
bill $100, you get like $97.01. That's not how it works. That 2.9% discount rate, you
also have a rolling reserve for six months, which means that another 5% to 10% of
your money doesn't get paid to you for six months and will only get - well, it's just to
protect the processor.

SCI.106

Investing in science will save you

You know only science is going to save your life, and so science needs funding so they can
eat and buy cool machines, but you're worried because you're greedy and you like to have
lots of money that when you buy a stock in a scientific company that it's going to go down.
Between you and me the price of the stock going down only matters if you are going to sell,
and if you sell how the fuck are they supposed to do any of the science that they need to do
in order to save your life 10-20 years from now.

In effect if you buy a stock in a company that may eventually save your life through one of
the cool products they make THEN if the price drops in half it doesn't matter, because
whatever money that you put into that company that they used to do a good thing. Now



you have to cancel out the effect of other people selling their stock by definitely NOT selling
yours or even buying more so that they can continue to have the funding necessary to keep
doing what they are doing. In effect if you really do want to save your life by investing
biotech you need to never sell your stock, and if in fact you're never going to sell your stock
anyway it almost doesn't matter what happens to the price.

Specific health directed funding

Like, if you're a man... let's say you're a gay man, right? And you care about saving you and
your loved one - oh, by the way, Peter Thiel is gay. Gay, Christian, Libertarian. Wouldn't it be
great if you could donate to prostate cancer? It's going to pay off better than the breast
cancer because both you and your partner are 80 times more likely to get it than breast
cancer. Anyway, my point is that I'm glad that somebody figured out to do what I plan to do
and have been planning to do for a goddamn decade, that I've been too addicted to games
to give a shit.

Save your ASSets fund.

A donation has been made under your name to the humans fund

Why do we have a "Save Your Trees" global awareness fund, but we don't have a
"Save the Humans" global awareness fund? Humans matter more than trees. If we
give a fuck enough about trees to try and save them, we should care about the
humans. So, we need a "Save Your Ass" fund.

specially designed software that just runs on it. I want a general purpose personal computer
and I want some software that will let me do that. I wonder if there are companies that are
out there building that. Oh, there are like Microsoft and Apple. I should invest in one of
those companies because you know what, if it works I'm going to get really rich and one day


if it works, I'll be able to actually use the thing they built." Now, imagine you had that logic
then before Microsoft was huge and imagine how fucking rich you'd be. You'd be very rich.

Making Billions isn’t as good as amplfying the sector.

Summary

We analyzed research funding distribution for different cancers in the United
States. Based on burden metrics including incidences, mortalities, economic
costs, and Years of Life Lost (YLL) we identified inequities in cancer research
funding relative to burden. Overfunded cancers include breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and leukemia; underfunded cancers include bladder, esophageal, liver,
oral, pancreatic, stomach, and uterine cancer. We recommend redistribution
from overfunded cancers to underfunded cancers to improve the effectiveness
of cancer research funding.

Awareness

What people will pay for, and are willing to do dictates the world we live in

Let's say you could flip a switch and turn everyone in the world into a doctor. Now you have
more and more people good at fixing others, and little research in the sciences and projects
that future doctors would have relied on. Just like a healthy ratio of biting to chewing and
swallowing, there needs to be a healthy ratio of application and research. We are so very,
very far away from a healthy weighting amongst these things, that improvements can be
easily had.

Let me give you an example. If we assume that the humans in the world we live in do what
they do because they choose to, which is more or less the idea behind abolishing slavery.
Then we can infer that what humans do is a function of what humans want to do. The
question then becomes simply, how healthy and useful is what humans currently and are
likely to want in the near future compared to what's possible? How much human effort is
spent kicking and throwing rubber through metal hoops and gambling, and even gambling
on the rubber ball kicking? If you were forced to make a list of the multifarious ways









humans waste their time, you'd probably die with hands crippled from the effort long
before the task was complete.

Increase the awareness

It's my belief that people do what they care about, and they care about what they are pretty
much very well advertised to care about, but pretty much only well-advertised to care
about, and already have a natural emotional propensity to develop a caring for, and so that
"competitive (I'd rather they die than me)"kind of feeling we have it so rarely in life, because
we lead such a life of leisure, I think it's part of the reason that sport is so popular.

You can experience those same emotions of "this is really important, and I have to win, and
it's super important", but the funny thing is that....it's not...it's just a construction, you are
constructing something that you can think is super important so that you could feel those
feelings that used to be much more common, and that's what a Halloween house is or a
scary movie, to trigger some emotions that you never get to feel. A piece of meat flopping
around a very nice safe city with round edges everywhere.

I want to use the language, and create the framework that bring out the light that will

that no one is noticing or paying attention to.

R98

You never read the same book twice. It's a cool saying. It's like never stepping in the same
river twice, but until you actually have seen the same movie twice and fucking been like,

"Oh, I didn't notice this, that, this, that, this, that, this, that, holy shit. I'm a different
person." It doesn't have the same mental effect. And so if you're not old enough to have
ever gotten a movie and then re watched it as though it were new, and noticed a million
new things, I'm not sure that you can truly understand how much a person changes. Maybe
you would have to interview someone who hates the tattoo they just got off, you know,
Nickelback or whatever. Maybe then you could understand what it's like to truly change in
taste.

R180

Anyway, I agree with Daniel Dennet on a whole lot of stuff, particularly the problem, the
theoretical, hard problem of consciousness, and his position on free will, where all of these
neuroscientists are trying to say that human beings don't really have free will because they
can measure our brains and know what we're going to do before we do it. Well, that's great,
but I've been with myself for longer than you've put that machine on me, and so I had the
chance to meta-influence, even if you could predict what I was going to do before I did it,

I've had the chance to meta-influence the directionality of my decision making for a longer
period of time so that perhaps I don't have infinite power to control what I'm doing in the
microseconds before you, after you measure and you can predict it, but I did hours ago,
right?

Transhumanism

Transhumanists have a time-frame problem. They're very concerned with the
opportunities and problems of people who are not going to be them. You must earn
the right to be around to face those future challenges. As it stands, just like nearly all
of the futurists of the past, they're dead, they don't get to see all the robots, flying
cars and shiny clothes of 2017.

If you like nanobots, try your hand at the white blood cell, it's pretty great at what it
does. You'll get farther hacking it, than trying to build your own nanobot version.
Same for trees. Pick up where nature left off. Nature's already done a pretty great
job of it over the very long time it's had. Imagine the difficulty of building an
artificial tree, compared to efficiently planting more.

Build the future you wish to see. Biotech, the life you save may be your own.


Transhumanists are to progress what movie goers are to filmmaking. Spectators.

Mind uploading won't work

The memory isn't in the meat, it is the meat.

https://youtu.be/JJ i4allguoU?t=579

If you could you would probably cease to be you. 4chan hackers may pwn
your soul.

The reason mind uploading will not work,is that human memory can't be
extracted from the substrate, the physical meat.

I guess a way to understand it is the experiment in evolutionary circuitry
where they let code edit and evolve itself to hear and identify two
different tones. And after a couple thousand iterations it did a really good
job at it, and the time came to find out how the chip evolved to do the
task, https://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits/

It turns out they couldn't figure it out, and that removing unused pieces of
code broke it, and moving it to a different chip broke it, it was using things
that we don't know how to use. They theorize it had to do with threshold
voltages, and that the very specific entropy and uniqueness of that
individual chip was basically the epigenetics that wouldn't allow it to be
transferred to another chip.

P.S. Digital security is a competition, whoever has more money wins. If
you brain becomes data you WILL be hacked. Or perhaps there's so many
copies of you, you don't mind losing a few. The good news is as long as
the meat is the data, there shall be no mind uploading, so you don't have
to worry about digital OPSEC.

Profit cuts through bullshit.







Many things that waste peoples time have been the result of building things at great
expense that people truly didn't want, and definitely wouldn't pay for. Charging for
things is the universal decision maker. If what you are doing is awesome, you can
charge for it. Hell, you should charge for it. An interesting saying is "Never do what
you're good at for free, or something along those lines." You don't have to be
charitable, you do have to focus on solving the problem, even for profit. No analysis
paralysis from too many good options.

You don't have to figure out what's best, you do have allocate 5 percent, whether its
half of your 10 you are saving, or 5 more on top for 15 of total. Foundation, allocate
funds, take 5 percent of gross income as revenue. 5 percent club. Alternatives to allow
parallel investment if they don't' like you. Profit if they don't' like charities, and like
profit, then give them list of profit seeking startups who if successful further our
cause. Government, give them list of low hanging fruit that can be side channel
marketed, without the longevity battle conversation. If 80 percent of medical costs
occur in the last year of life, let's just move that last year as far away as possible.
Example diabetes research through SIRT pathways. Results in massive side benefits,
likely.

Curing things

As a trick to understand how important it is to cure things imagine a world where xx percent
of people have xx and this and that and the other thing, now imagine that you had the
chance to cure them all, and you did it 20 years earlier. Now it's hard to imagine how
important it is because you didn't have a chance to see how bad it used to be. You have to
imagine the way the world could be and isn't due to hard work. And then take that same
lesson and apply to how the world could be, but must not be because of your hard work!

A great reason to cure a thing, is that you don't' have to treat it anymore, and you don't
have to consume other people's lives with the treatment, the majority of costs of taking
care of old people are the human costs that it takes more than 1 person to take care of 1
person, so you have a problem that's very hard to solve, it's the reason why I've heard that
it might be more effective to cripple an enemy soldier than to kill him, because you are
technically disabling more than 1 enemy unit with the injury, whereas with the death, you
are only getting rid of one. You would have to account for the return to battle one day in the
future however of the non-dead soldier, so you could consider it a short term gain with a
long term cost, sort of like buying something on a credit card and not paying it off at the end
of the month.

Pricing Survival technology

Can cost you a percentage of your net worth, just like getting married does. It doesn't need
to be priced at a flat rate.

Misc.

Serendipity and the law of attraction - so the older you get, the more things you see, the
easier it is for you to make connections, the easier it is for you to see connections where
they don't really exist or where they do exist, they don't exist in the way that you wish they
did. If for example, you find some interesting coincidence. Let's say you Google one thing,
and then you're going through the day and you Google some other thing, and then those
two things somehow magically both relate to a third thing.



What you'll find more often than not is that the reason that those two seemingly so
distantly related things actually relate is because all of you - the thing that influenced the
first result, the thing that influenced the second result, and the thing that influenced you -
were all quite popular and were pre-selected for popularity. When you use Google, it gives
you popular responses. When you get the results that are on Google, the things that are
referenced are popular things that people are aware of. And due to this compounding
popularity effect the likelihood that one unrelated thing is seemingly attached to some
other unrelated thing, uh and then you find them actually related - it's because that
relation, it's a side effect of all of you being directed by a third outside cause. It's not
because the two things were actually pushing on each other.

It's not the world trying to fulfill your goals and your destinies because you've been looking
at your dream board. It's a side effect of you creating the dream board that you did because
you were influenced, and those guys having little internal dream boards of their own being
influenced in the same way, as in referencing each other and being found by Google in
similar ways. I could give you more specific examples that would be ultimately more useful. I
guess I will. If you are reading the news and hearing about Islamic terror, then you may have
seen an image that says that a possible solution to this is by tainting the methods of
executing people guilty of executable crimes, particularly in the terrorist field is using pork.

That, you know, the theory is that if these people are willing to kill for their beliefs and their
beliefs say that you're strictly punished if you are dirtied by this dirty animal, the swine, that
you may be able to use people's beliefs that you may consider to be crazy beliefs, however
they may feel are quite rational. You may be able to use their beliefs in order to enhance the
likelihood that they remain lawful and don't commit, you know, crimes - particularly crimes
that have death penalties attached to them in most societies or many. There's this guy who
is attributed as a legend to have done the whole pork bullet thing, and his name is captain
Black Jack Pershing.

You'll have to check that name specifically. And then as I was Googling this man named
Richard James Hart that turns out to be a hidden secret older brother to Al Capone. And Al
Capone was an alcohol smuggler, and his older brother Richard James Hart was actually an
anti-alcohol smuggler who put guys like that in jail. And one of the claims to fame that "Two
Guns" Richard James Hart has is that he was commended by the General Black Jack Pershing
for the good performance he had in some war. And it was just interesting that you find a
legend of a man over here, and then only hours later from searching some weird name and
finding some weird thing about some weird guy, some trivia, you see that same, long-dead
General mentioned again.

You think that somehow these things are being shown to you because they're trying to fulfill
your goal and the thing that you're searching for. The reason that you search for the first
thing and the reason that you search for the second thing - now you found this unifying
factor between these two seemingly unrelated things. But in actuality, Google found both of
them because they were both popular and the first guy mentioned that he was commended
by this dude and not in the other dude because he was popular. For the very same reason
that the writer of the legend or the inventor of the legend chose Mr. General or Admiral
Pershing is the same reason that the man who chose his own name from scratch - Richard



James Hart was originally something-or-another Capone - you know, he invented that
name, he chose it, there was reasons why he chose it.


He also chose to mention that he was commended by this person for the same reason that
he chose to mention that he was commended by that guy is the same reason the legend, I'd
venture, chose that guy. It's not that those two people are being shown to you to fulfill
some dream that you had that may be on your dream board and that you've manifested this
into reality. In reality you are all, all being effected by a third cause, which is Mr. Pershing
had a cool ass name and went down in history as a super cool dude to refer to because he
did a ton of really interesting things with his life and he had a very interesting name. I guess
you could say similar to "Two Guns" Richard James Hart because you don't get a cool
nickname like that that's in Wikipedia and, you know, mentioned in popular culture, unless
you did some pretty cool stuff to earn it or you were a fictional character.

But if you're a real person with a cool nickname like that, there's a real chance that you
earned it by doing cool stuff. You the searcher, those guys, 50, 100 years ago, they were all
influenced by motive. They were all influenced by the same, uh, desire to achieve the same
objectives and to look cool or sound cool or be knowledgeable or be effective in this world.
And now in hindsight, in the future, we think that something in the current, in the present, is
influencing the world to make these things pop up, when in reality what's influencing these
things to pop out now are things that occurred 50 and 100 years ago that are only coming to
fruition today. You could have predicted 100 years ago that since he was the only guy at the
time with a super bad ass name, if a legend were to get created, it would be referencing him
if they wanted to add authenticity to the legend by mentioning a truly historical, real thing,
real world figure that was once alive.

You could consequently say that people that are choosing to mention this war hero for
props and respect for the good that they did in wars today, you know, they're going to
mention that guy because he was the general and he served with them and it really
happened. 100 years from now that's what's going to show up in your Wikipedia page when
people look you up is this guy was third-party approved to be cool by this guy who was
widely respected to be an authority on who should be given commendations and what they
should be given for in the realm of war, so to speak. In summary, I think what you'll find is
you'll have more of these feelings of serendipity the more you use Google or voice
recognition, right? I had a friend that one time, she, spoke tongues into her phone and her
phone gave her, you know, very interesting, accurate results because she didn't realize that
the phone didn't have a choice.

The phone was going to give the best guess no matter what, and the best guess is always
going to give you good results. I, to teach her the error of her ways, the error that, you
know, she thought that there was meaning coming from the phone even though she was
speaking gibberish into it, I spoke gibberish into it, and it also gave meaningful results
because it had no choice but to give meaningful results. We were the ones that tried to
pretend that the meaning came from what we said. But in reality, the meaning came from
random chance. Some meaning had to be output, and we were the ones making the
connection between those two meanings - the gibberish being spoken into the phone and
the interesting, unique outcome coming out the other side. The more intelligent you are and



the better story teller you are, the more connections you can make, the more believable you
can make these false correlations that have no causation.

There's literally a meme that makes fun of this called the "Half Life 3 Confirmed Meme"
where you just choose random things and then say that those random things share very,
very well. Let's just give an example. Okay, Half Life 3 has the number three in it. Gabe
Newell runs Steam. Steam made Half Life 2. Gabe Newell spoke three times this year. He
didn't speak four. He didn't speak five. Therefore, Half Life 3 confirmed. Then you just make
all those abstractions larger and larger to the point where, yes. If you're willing to count the
letters in a thing and you use first names and basically - if you know how the Seven Degrees
of Kevin Bacon works, if you're willing to make very loose connections and count them as
significant, then almost everything in the world is only seven degrees away from everything
else.

If you're willing to take any single thing and count all the things that touch it, and then all
the things that touch those and then all the things that touch those and do that seven times,
you end up with all the things that have ever existed and may even...it's probably vastly less
than seven degrees if you accurately count all the connections between one thing and
another thing that are possible. I mean, everything in the world might be joined by four
connections. That is to say, as effective pattern-finding machines with the power of Google
and other bad ass search tools that are always going to give you an interesting result and
pre-select know what you're going to find interesting because they're monitoring what
other people are clicking.

That's how they generated the list in the first place is they've charted human understanding
of what is important for certain key word search. But they know because they count how
many people point to that page with the anchor text of what you've searched for, right?
That's how you created a, you know, uh, I think in the2000s there was a Google bomb, they
called it Google bombing when you just link to something that you want to make fun of
someone. So they linked to George W. Bush's homepage or, uh, identity. You'll have to
check specifically what page they linked to. But if you Googled terrible failure, you would get
George W. Bush's homepage. That habit of Google following what people think and trying to
figure out what people think by reading the links that they create - human created links.

The links say that terrible failure should take you to George Bush's site. Well, then the
engine thinks, "Oh, well, maybe this site means terrible failure," right? And it's actually a
challenge for the engine to know the difference between purposefully influenced for a joke
or political statement, link behavior, linking behavior, and then more natural I inks created
to help users find what their looking for style of behavior.

Selling medicine over technology

Funny presentation idea, disprove transhumanism. So everyone, Steve Jobs is a serious
threat, he’s going to use his super technology to replace all his body parts, and his superior
technology will let him take over the world, he must be stopped. Act like you don’t know he
died, and then open the floor to questions and comments. Then act real surprised like the
Key and Peele Halloween Michael Jackson episode. Where the children at.

Craig Venter claims photo of human from DNA

More at: https://youtu.be/fDSQMeRgZHM?t=13m40s

Are you your DNA?



In an interview with Craig Venter, he states that you can literally make a photo of a person
from just their DNA, and turn their DNA into their voice, and know their age. And that only a
few years ago he would have told you some of that was impossible. So if that's accurate,
and it likely is given his reputation, then anonymity is over, because even if you try to not
have your DNA sequenced, we’re leaving DNA everywhere all the time, and it can’t and
shouldn't’ be protected by law, and thus, I don’t really think there’s an advantage to not
being sequenced. Basically you're just giving the world less of a head start on doing the
things that might save your life.

Longevity

Common beliefs

Keep in mind that repair components are eukaryote cells, and they have two built in rules
that are important here:

1) any individual cell, once X energy passes through them, they senescence

2) from the ovum you grew out of until the last cell alive when you die, only 128 cell
divisions happen in that line

That means there is a finite supply of these repair components, these cells, and so there is a
limit to how much energy can go through your body before you die.

Therefore, you probably want to make sure "peak" effort in any reasonable time interval
(e.g. a month, maybe a week) is pretty high, to encourage the machinery to remain well-
maintained, but average effort is as low as possible. You should exercise to have a huge
amount of effort for maybe 10-15 minutes per month, sprinting for instance, getting your
heartrate up to 130+, and keeping it up for a short while, maybe 20-30 minutes, no more.
Other than that, you should probably avoid exercise and eat healthy. There are other
reasons gym is not a particularly good kind of exercise. It's just not very realistic. Running or
biking in the real world, aside from being more fun than in a gym, is also a lot better for you.
And probably, having a weekly game of basketball is far better than that.

Medical research pays better than preventing low probability extinction level events

The difference working on extinction level events and working on longevity is longevity is
guaranteed to give you dividends, guaranteed to have a pay off at some point. Even by
accident whereas working on extinction level events is not guaranteed to make you do shit
you could prepare very heavily for an asteroid strike, and when it doesn't occur unless you
like re-task it for asteroid mining. All you end up with is a lot of effort into something that
was entirely wasted and didn't work.

R38

Most of your body gets worse and never better without science

Joints only get worse, teeth only get worse, lung capacity, strength, hair moves from the top
of your head to out your ears and on your back. When you have a compelling reason to use
soap on your scalp and shampoo on the rest of your body, you’ll know what it means.
Epigenetic differences

A lot of people are talking shit about how stress in the body, like for instance, adrenaline
being commonly present might addict the child to adrenaline? I don't know, if it works for
crack, I think it works for these other hormones that people hunt.





How to use your body

You should never chew ice. Apparently if you change the position of your legs and you squat
while you shit or maybe you lean over real far on the toilet and it helps with your shitting.
The safety position of being turned on your side when you're passed out drunk or knocked
out. If they throw up they don't choke and die on their own vomit. All of those things seem
like they would be great additions to like the user manual on how to use your body. They
should teach you in school, but most never get taught. Like in the winter if your skin is itchy
you should lotion up mother fucker, who knew that? I was never taught that shit. I learned
that from a comedy special from Bill Burr when I was 30. You think there's something wrong
because of itchy skin but it's just really dry.

Coolness of nonchalance

Some people think they are cool and not needy because they're down with death. They
don't realize that every minute drawing breath is a giant fuck you to the grim reaper, they're
just as uncool of the rest of us still breathing people.

Naming overhead

Kids got named at 5 years old 200 years ago perhaps because they died so often before then
that you'd waste time naming one early?

Treating causes instead of effects, ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure.

Content...?

Correct action is difficult and requires quality data

These things people need to know. People need to know that, these things that I'm telling
you are facts and are fucking true. If you don't know them, you can't make good decisions.
Period. Some of the most powerful, intelligent people in the world that you meet don't
know them. Period. How can you expect them to have correct action? If people don't realize
that curing cancer is only worth three fucking years, how can they come to the conclusion
that increases in lifestyle may get you three years? It literally means that if you did a
marketing campaign for like fitness and diet, you might do better for mankind than curing
cancer. That's fucked up. That's like, "What? That's really hard to believe." But you wouldn't
know that unless you knew the numbers.

SCI.46

Curing cancer only gets us four years

Now I'm going to really blow your mind, right? So the 40% of people die of cancer that was
like, "Oh, that's pretty fucking interesting." If you cured cancer - cured it, eliminated it, it's
no longer a thing - how much longer do you think people would live? A newborn child is
born into a world where cancer doesn't exist. How much longer is he going to live? [silence
27:11.1 - 27:26.2] Four? That's very fucking close. You're going to be the third person that's
ever been close. It's three years. Yeah, I really moved the bar. I know. If I kind of move the
bar that much, most people guessed 20. Yeah. I guessed 20 when I first heard it.

SCI.29

Curing heart disease only gets us three years

Aubrey de Grey has got the SENS Foundation. We need more. Oh, curious fact, by the way. If
you cure heart disease, you also only get three years. But mathematically, if you cure both
of them, you get seven years. Yeah. Someone tried to - Aubrey tried to explain that to me
and it was like... [silence 69:24.2 - 69:31.1] See - yeah. That particular logic seems like it
would work the opposite way to me. Like, I could understand it, but it would take 45
minutes to understand it.

SCI.66

Anti-Aging Tech



Anti-aging technology that could make you 30 when you're 50 gives you another 20 years to
kick ass. That's great. That's fucking fabulous. People have this thing called the Tithonus
error, which is named after a Greek or Roman myth where some guy wanted immortality,
and you know how it is with these funny old stories. He gets tricked, and he gets to be
immortal while becoming more and more physically shitty. He has like the physically
shittiest life, but he's still alive. Well, turns out that real longevity research doesn't work like
that.

Once you become frail, you're fucked. We can make you not become frail for a really long
time, if it works. But once you're frail, we can't really help you. Just the whole pound of
prevention - ounce of prevention, pound of cure. I wonder if that saying still works in the
metric world. Probably. I think they know that an ounce is smaller than a pound, which
should be enough.

SCI.70

Longevity Research

Why do I mention that? Because the number of people, they're defeatist about aging
research is so great, and it's so heavy handed that you almost want to skip it entirely. Like, if
this book was written for a lower intellectual level, you would want to skip it entirely and
just make it fit into their existing belief structures, and just be like, "Hey, create the subset
of diseases that is the most related to aging, and then focus on curing those." And then you
get these hidden side effect benefits that you don't mention. Like, yeah, we're going to cure
diabetes. Oh, and as a side effect, it also fixes this [inaudible 73:58.7], It should make us live
a lot longer. Or like you said, you could personalize. You're like, "Oh, I'm going to get this, so
I should work on that."

SCI.71

Most care about their family, but

I believe the vast majority of human beings cares about their family, themselves, their loved
ones, their friends, more than they care about random people that they couldn't speak to
no matter how hard they tried. I think that's - [silence 76:19.8 - 76:27.6] [inaudible 76:27.7]
[silence 76:28.5 - 76:37.8] Say how much is Charles Manson's life worth?

Or Osama Bin Laden's, better example. Like how much are you willing to work to keep us
[inaudible 76:45.4] alive? I don't know. That guy looked like an asshole. Maybe I'm not
comfortable dying earlier because Bill's outlook on life is different than mine. But it's his
money, and he's a fucking hero, and he's doing amazing things for the world. More power to
that guy. I'd like to see him work as heated asshole guy that wants to actually help people
that are like himself.

SCI.74

Life expectancy

There was a Reddit thread on things that you can actually be happy about that are going on
in the world. I think it was triggered by the Belgian bombings that went on- the Brussels, I
guess, is a better way to put it. One of the posts was that we've gained six years of life
expectancy since nineteen ninety. That's pretty fuckin' cool.

619

Anti-aging investment

It could be the case that you should run your anti-aging investment the same way that you
care about your life, in that if you don't really care if the universe continues do exist after
you die, and you're alright with everything coming to a stop when you do, then you really



should only focus on non-extinction level events, because the preparation for X events only
pays off in the very rare case that an X event actually occurs, whereas the bullshit of aging is
guaran-fucking-teed going to happen to you unless you get hit by a bus, therefore I'm
intellectually much more interested in doing the things we know are coming that aren't X
events, whereas my lizard brain likes better to think about the fun and wild zombie
apocalypse events much better.

Peter Thiel & Longevity

At this point, one of the problems is its longevity research; in fact, Peter Thiel talked about it
quite a bit. Last month at a university seminar, he was asked: "Well, what is the technology
that you are looking forward to?" He paused for a moment, as a matter of fact, this was his
answer: "You know, that question is a little bit tricky, because if I answer it, basically, I'll be
screwing myself out of some profit". Right. Instead, he talked about research on ageing.

Why does that worry me? Because it means he’s not working on it. Right? So if his internal
mental thought process was: "I don't want to give away anything here, but I do want to
speak about something that matters," then his thought process was: "What important thing
could I mention that I wish someone else was working on, but I'm not?" That was his
answer. It was a compelling answer. It was nice. I'm glad he cares, and it shows in his
funding, and it shows in his interviews, right?

SCI.23

What do we need? Where does Progress come from?

It's well understood. It's a fact. People make billions of dollars every year on knowing these
things the right way, and we know them the right way. What do we need? Well, compare -
so if the SENS Foundation's research works out - okay, let's talk some exciting shit with you
real quick. If people live longer, right, how much better would the world be?

Well, where does progress comes from? Progress comes from heroes, and the accidents
that they make. People are working in one place, and then hey, fuck, look, this new amazing
thing happened. Sometimes this new amazing thing and it's actually the thing I was working
on. That happens too, right?

SCI.68

What if the hero's stop dying?

What happens to these guys? They get to the swing of things in their 20s, do some great
work, and you get about 40 years' effort out of them, and then they die. But what if they
stop dying? What if the people are at the top of their fucking game, and we’re still around,
kicking ass? What if Albert Einstein didn't have to pause to die and just kept fucking
working? And what if he wasn't alone?

What if the other people whose ideas he built off, and the other people that built off of his
ideas were all still alive and all still working together, you would get the sum greater than
the parts. You would get Metcalfe's law. You would get not only more progress, but better
progress and faster progress because the forefront of technological understanding and
advancement keeps fucking rotting and dying. It's a huge problem for mankind, and a pretty
huge problem for the person that died.

SCI.69

Dream and do, don't just dream



Longevity enthusiasts are too focused on an outcome and not on the actions to obtain it.
When you focus on what you want, to the exclusion of the behaviors that result in it, your
dreams don't come true. Dreams are only as useful as they turn into behaviors.

The science of a longer health span

Curing diseases is curing aging, you're already supporting it, you just didn't' realize it.

Curing causes instead of effects

Explain why you have to cure cancer no matter what anyway however you need to
cure it before it happens not after it happens, if you are able to cure it before it
happens then you will get more than 3 years, because whatever you are doing to fix it
is going to fix the other things that were the things that were going to kill you instead.
Cures that affect more than just the thing you are trying to cure give you a
multiplicative curative effect.

Cure cancer, get 3 years
Cure heart disease get 3 years.

Fund us, get more than 3 years.

Insurance companies

The whole concept of marketing and profit eating 1/3 of the money that goes into health
care is very tragic. The best outcome for the world of health care is for health insurance
companies to be dissolved and for the state that's already in charge of keeping the humans
save via the military and other armed forces such as the police, i.e. in charge of the legalized
violence, to also be in charge of the opposite function of legalized health care.

The countries in the world that get the highest and best outcomes for their citizens in the
health arenas, and at the lowest costs are always the countries that don't lose 1/3 of their
budget to useless advertising and profiting of huge swaths of people that aren't doing any
healing. Mr. corporate executive marketing guy can't prescribe you anything, nor cut out a
tumor, nor set a bone, he's just a leech on the system. Let him go find more honest and
gainful employment by dissolving his industry.

Insurance companies don't keep clients long enough these days to care about their long

Pro Death People

Imagine hearing this guy's copy speaking 100 years ago about how awesome dying at
45 was. And as we make progress more and more guys just like this one will come out
of the wood work to tell you about how awesome dying is, which is funny, because
had his older copy won the argument, this guy wouldn't be around to spout this crap
now.

If we're going to be loose and fast with our claims, as I see you are, then I can tell you
that arguing publicly against medical research and progress kills children. The things
we work on help all humans, you and old, and so no matter how hard we might try to
focus on just aging things, the work will do will help some children as well. Thus in
effect you're arguing for dead kids. Nearly all medical research ends up being useful
one day or another to saving the lives of kids. Stop killing the kids fearful pro death
guy.

By the way, this progress is going to be made whether you argue against it or not,
when you're well dead and rotting, those of us still around will still be making progress
in medicine, and at some point whether we tried or not, we'll live longer, the only
question is, is it better to have it faster to help our loved ones, or to watch our loved
ones die before the tech exists. If you want to die early, go by yourself, don't ask me
and the rest of the world to join you, it is the cowards way out.

We have famine and war and poverty, yeah they suck, which one of those killed
100,000 people today? So you're an ageist then, old people's right to live doesn't
matter as everyone else's, got it.

If you support dying earlier instead of later, then you should overeating and not
exercising, maybe smoking and hard drugs, because just like your advice, they will get
you faster to your buddy death.

Think of all the ways you land on medicine as the correct path. Tired of spending
money on old people? 90 percent of the health care budget? Well, kill them, or heal
them. Which do you prefer. What about people who might just get there soon, should
we kill them before they start racking up healthcare bills?

If you must group people and label them, better you label them by profession than
race. Profession over nationality is probably pretty good as well. What has more of an
effect on what I know, what I do, and how I think about things, what I do for a living,
or where I was born?

Wow, the longest living people are dying off and have negative population growth,
because not dying is only valuable linearly, but childbirth is valuable geometrically so.

Working on aging doesn't make you immortal, and it doesn't stop death, it just works
on aging. And working on aging doesn't pay quickly, it only pays very slowly over time,



if you did it perfectly in a single year, you'd only get 1 extra year per year, if you didn't
die from non-aging things. How about we do it, and if we don't like all the improved
health we're getting, let's just fuck ourselves up and stop working on it, break each
other's arms or something.

The invisible cocked gun, longevity

If you saw a man walking around town with a bicycle helmet on, in this case, a very special
bicycle helmet. This helmet had a firearm attached, firing directly into the wearers head.
You'd have to ask the person why they would be so stupid as to wear something that was
supposed to protect them, and then destroy the purpose of that thing by having something
that was supposed to harm you sticking right through it.

So imagine you ask this man, why are you wearing such a stupid and dangerous thing, and
received this response: Don't worry about it, I know it's there, but it's more fun to live my
life not worrying about it, and besides, the trigger only pulls very, very, slowly. I know it will
kill me one day, but that day is likely very far in the future, as long as I don't get hit by a bus
or let anything get in the trigger guard and press too hard on the trigger for too long.

Mind you own business he says, I want to live my life how I want to live it! My parents and
grandparents all died from headshots from these types of helmets, so it's quite normal, and
I don't feel like missing out on life by trying to find a way to get out of this trap, so just leave
me alone!

How many great people have died the same way their parents have? You see a parent
destroy his life with alcohol, and then you see the son do the same. Why is it so hard for
people to put up a fight against something that is so obviously going to kill them?

We all have invisible guns pointed at our heads, and the triggers are being squeezed slowly.
Some things we do shake the triggers dangerously; some things relieve the pressure on the
trigger a bit. Some of us put up a good fight against inevitability, others, not so much. Learn
from others mistakes, if you see someone's face missing, and their brains blown out against
a wall, try not to do the things they did that let them end up like that.

Everyone's invisible gun helmet is a little different. They seem to be handed out at birth like
a combination of your mom's and dad's, just like you yourself. Some peoples have long
trigger pulls. Some have hair triggers. Some fire a bullet of such a low caliber that you can
survive the first shot, maybe even the second. Since the damned gun in invisible, you have
to figure out what yours looks like by the effects of your parents had on them, if that's the
way they died.

Know thy enemy. Know thyself. How did you parent die? Their parents? Now fight. DO NOT
DIE LIKE THEY DID! PUT UP A FIGHT! Have the courage and responsibility to die with a fight
and not a whimper. We're lucky enough to have the tools to actually put up a great fight
these days!

Aging Populations

I see these aging populations worried about losing their perceived former greatness, and
they think that importing all kinds of new blood within the borders of their country is the
path to greatness and to have some backs to load the weight of their aging populations on
top of, however if they were slightly smarter, they would learn from apple and America's
example, in that you can take all of the profit from a business and all of the excellence from
a business, and leave the slavery and margin less working for free and danger and pollution
in someone else's country, while you get to keep all the profit, all the intellectual property
and quite literally get farther and farther ahead to the point where you are the most
profitable company in the world.


You not only don't get any of the pollution from the manufacture, you can externalize all the
destructive to the earth costs, and you can have below market wages that would be illegal
where you operate, but hell you don't even have to bring your profits back either, you can
leave your profits outside the country as well and let them grow tax free.

Apathetic to survival

I think part of the reason that people don't fight hard enough for life, is that they're perhaps
not that passionate about life? If I really wanted to sell someone on the idea of survival,
perhaps the same things that influence in their day to day life would work here, for instance,
procrastination. Die later, not today.

Numbers worth fighting for

I never heard of this math put this way; every day you'd extend the average human lifespan.
You get an extra 270 000 entire human lifespans out of it, because you're applying that
across 7.5 billion people. I used an average health lifespan of 70 years. It's probably longer,
but it was just the number I chose. You're getting at least 250 000 extra entire human lives
out of increasing the average human lifespan by a single day. That's worth fighting for.

Cryonics blows?

What if cryonics started working? I think cryonics is weak as fuck. I should put some thought
into it to try to figure out why. I would assume it's because they're quite terrible at it
currently, and if the tech appeared to put you back together after being that fucked up, then
















the tech would also exist to make mass copies, edits and remixes of you. I'm less excited
about busting my ass to become a remix I guess. I don't want 4chan to pwn my soul.

Biology is the future

The most precious commodity in this universe is human consciousness, and the only place
we are aware of it is in human bodies.

In a speech by Paul Graham, who was talking about the book he wrote called "The hard
thing about hard things", he says that the future is where biology meets information, which
is funny because all biology is information. Every single living thing that we are aware of in
this universe is merely executed code in the language of ateg, in dna. No DNA, no life.

He isn't the only one to feel this way, we know have human longevity Inc., calico, and 500
million dollars of synthetic biology startup funding this year alone (2015). There's a
conference in San Francisco, and there's a synthetic biology startup accelerator headed up
by Bill Liao in Cork, Ireland.

Google also has its own X department concerned with moonshot ideas, and the
ycombinator CEO, Sam Altman has just started their own moonshot team and funded their
first synthetic biology company. The tides are turning so that we will have the tools that we
need to save our very own lives. Ycombinator now has a fund for biotech headed by Vijay
Pande.

As great as these things are, more is better. The availability of the transistors and electrical
components in the 80's allowed apple to get its start in a garage, and so must the tools to
improve our own bodies be available at home to get the same type of experimentation and
progress. When we can tinker with biology the same way that men love to tinker and
engage with electronic gadgets today, we will see an explosion of innovation and progress.
What do we need?

What do we need? We need more people becoming researchers now to create the products
within the next ten years to go through the FDA for 5 or 10 years to be ready in 20 years
when I actually want to fucking use them and I'll be 56 years old. That's what we need. You
can do that same math for you. If we work on saving people that are already old and doing
more of what we already know, it won't save you, it'll just save them. If we work on getting
safer from Russians, it won't save you, it won't save anybody.

By the way if you work on making the world a better place by improving the economy, that's
like trying to suck researchers through a very small straw. You made less people have to
drive taxis so now there's less people wasting their time driving cars so now those people
can flip burgers and the burger flippers can become secretaries and the secretaries can
become researchers and then somehow, after sucking on a straw, very, very hard you might
get a researcher out of the deal, maybe somehow. Fuck that! Let's get great progress
directly as much as possible and the rest of the world is just going to have to take the hit
and if the rest of the world gets better in the meantime which is likely that they will, that's
fabulous but let's not pretend that we're curing people's diseases by making cars run better





or curing people's diseases by making paint last longer curing disease any other way than
curing the disease.

I only see three things I give a shit about: biologically related things; processing artificial
intelligent things that allow us to do biology better; machines and imaging and diagnostics
and science and material science that allow us to do things in biology better. Things in that
area, computing, electronics, intelligence theory, that kind of stuff. Great that stuff is very
likely to help. Industries that cosmetics and sports get fucked.

Young ones making difference

Why do I mention that? Because I’m trying to come up with an answer as to who do we care
about. We care about everybody, but we care about them at a different time. Do I care
about students? Yeah. In 20 years, when the first - if a kid's six years old right now, 20 years
later, he's just now getting out of college. Now he can start to make a difference. I'm going
to be 55. I'm glad that this kid can start making a difference when I'm 55, and then maybe
have some cool discoveries and shit by the time I'm 60. But wouldn't it be cooler if that
same shit could happen when I was 45? How would I shift those productive discoveries 15
years earlier? By not injecting information into somebody that has such a long time before
they hatch, right?

Effective altruism

Effective altruism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective altruism

Example: The cost of a guide dog for the blind is $42,000.^ As an alternative, the cost of
performing surgery to correct trachealis, the blinding stage of trachoma, often costs as little
as $40 in developing countries.!^This surgery is 80% effective. Therefore, sight can be
restored to 840 people for the cost of one guide dog, and the guide dog does not restore
sights


From < https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective altruism >

One solution to this problem is to impose a time limit. For instance: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (1994—

Billionaires trying to make the world better

One need not be a billionaire to have no idea at all what is going on in other peoples
lives. To live in a bubble is more the rule than the exception.

Although I suggest everyone delete facebook, let's be fair to Zuckerberg. If the people
on facebook were better, facebook would be better. Much of the problems of
facebook come from the problems of the people on it. Sadly facebook seems to
amplify these problems by optimizing for time on site, making hidden decisions about
what you see and what you don't, etc.

A billionaire trying to make the world a better place is usually better than those that
could care less. I know that there's surely exceptions (perhaps putin, koch brothers,







etc.) It's not the status of billionaire that's important per say, but the quality of their
charitable endeavors.

"Connecting" the world is just a tactic, a means to an end, advocating for better ends
is superior. Sometimes people take the power you give them and do worse.
Technology on its own can be used for good and bad, you must advertise hard for the
good if you want the good.

In the end, I think if the world deleted facebook, it would be far better off than any
charitable deployment of funds the facebook founder could make.

Creating Scivivors. Scivive as religion.

The world needs more Scivivors

The more Scivivors there are, the happier and healthier we shall all be.

Masterplan to Billionaries

Life is quality x quantity.

Quality is far into diminishing returns. Quantity can be lOX'd. The best in their fields die,
right when they're most useful. What would Edison, Tesla, Franklin, Bell, Feynman, etc. be
producing currently if still alive?

Since quantity is literally the hardest problem we are aware of, how shall it be attacked? By
charity? Let's be serious, look around yourself right now, point to the things charity created.
Now cease the futile exercise.

Solutions:

1. Marketing as gates does, however all lives are not worth the same, you, your kin, your
friends, they are worth more. Fund the research that saves them, do not dream the silly
dream that all lives are worth the same.

2. Profit not charity, i.e. take a look at osfund.co (human longevity Inc.) sustain and grow,
not charity and run out of runway.

3. LONGEVITY FUND, or "save your assets fund" You can buy the S&P500 why not the
biotech index minus the companies solving problems you won't have. Reduced malaria drug
allocation, increased cancer and heart disease. Guess what. If you survive malaria, you are
still going to die of cancer and heart disease, so let's work on those 40 and 40 percent killers.

1. 1st book, personal excellence, things you can do to Scivive. Get rich, be loved, live
forever... *if selling ideas is good enough for Bill Gates, e.g. Gatesnotes.com,
givingpledge.org, its good enough for me, and you. Spread the word. This genre seems
easier to understand.

2nd book, things that are important, however are rarely actionable in your personal sphere
of influence (politics, currency, voting, economics, geopolitics, environment, interesting yet
un-actionable for the common man things.

3. Longevity fund. Biotech index minus things unlikely to be useful in saving you and your
loved ones lives.



4. Companies not a subset of Nasdaq Biotech index, too small, or in a different jurisdiction.

5. Biotech / Synbio startups.

6. Popularity improvement ala "The Martian" whereby science and tech becomes heroic as
kicking aliens in the face has been historically. The world need not hero worship the leather
ball throwing and kicking, steel lifting and lowering, non-scaling great strategies of 2,000
years ago. Let's make heroic the things that actual work these days. We need 20 year olds in
school now, learning for 5 years, creating for 2 and getting through FDA in 5. So if it takes 5
years to get that done, 5+5+2+5=17 years before these new scientists can help you, roughly.
How many humans can you heal? Can you save thyself and thy family?

How would you get rid of the old and institute the new?

There's a pretty limited number of strategies. You can kill your way through, but in order to
do that, you've got to be more than a good story teller. In order to kill your way through,
you've got to be a bad ass killing machine that can recruit, influence and control and
maintain order with other bad ass killing machines to kill so many fucking people that the
people that are left are like, "You know what? I would rather believe this new cool story and
stay alive than believe the old cold story."

Wealth, power and domination. Temporary friend checks, like girls' periods, if you have
good friend options to replace the shit. Fill your mental environment with what you want to
become. If you think about baseball all the time instead of sales and pricing, you are going
to get better at one and likely worse at the other. That is a funny thing about being human.

If you learn a thing and you don't use it, eventually you don't know it anymore. It's crazy just
like fitness, if you get fit and then stop working out one day, you aren't fit any more. Now,
it's not to say that the post forgetting state is the same as the pre, because post you can
refresh back to knowing faster than the first time you learned something.


If science is so great, and science is responsible for nearly all the awesome shit we have
now, then why hasn't science become more popular? Why aren't there many science t-
shirts? And why aren't there many science songs? And why aren't there many science
heroes? Well, because no artsy, smart, creative person has gone through the effort, except
perhaps for the guy who named his religion Scientology and was an asshole science fiction


author to start with. With bad teeth I might add, terrible teeth. If you want to have the same


impact in the world that everything that has preceded you has, than you better are meetin
the same needs. Xx Revise sentence, doesn't make sense. Until science has cheerleaders and


ne

'8


sports teams and songs, why the fuck would you want to join the science team? The science
team is not getting you laid, science team is not getting a sun tan and banging shots on the
beach. Well, we're kind of programmed for that type of state change to be favorable to us.


If you want science to start outperforming other things, then you better start meeting the
needs that people really have that science doesn't seem to care about. Science cares about
truth and learning about the real world, human beings not so much.


This will never be considered a success if it increases the number of people that see medical
progress and science as something good to do, preferably more so than rapping, balling and
banging the maximum number of chicks. If they want to see it as a path way to get the same








cool shit that those other activities are expected to get, that would be all right. Increase


funding, better career decisions an unconscious waiting of human behavior that puts healing
the fellow man and carrying you family medically and yourself medically as something that's
not an afterthought that you do at the end of the day after you sacrificed your 8 hour to


your corporate overlords. Xx Revise sentence, doesn't make sense. Maybe you and your
family should go first health, wealth and survival, and good living comes before profiteering.


I think that for the religiously inclined, if one of the best things Jesus did for this world is
heal man of sin and heal man of pain and disease, then you might want to learn from his
example. If you were given the power to heal your fellow man or yourself, you should feel
obligated to do so, for if you don't, that just a slower form of suicide. There are some
alternative paths that can be sold with longevity as a check point, I didn't think there was
but there are. For instance, you care about the progress of technology and you want the
smartest, most effective, cutting edge, bad ass people of the world to not rot and turn into
worm food and instead keep kicking ass, then they need to survive, perhaps not forever, but
maybe just a year longer, maybe that would be great.


Logo, song, dance, ritual, hand shake, shit that takes time to enforce "us versus them"
mentality, and right of passage, thus no freeloaders, transactional cost to avoid freeloaders.
Viral spread, unique benefit statement. What is the minimum viable associated bullshit that
has allowed other collective groups to be effective, such as scientologists, freemasons, I
guess some dumb ass cults, although I really hate to look to those guys for what works. I
guess there are things to learn from EST Forum in regards to group thinking, experience or
something. Theres a Wiki page on LGAT (Large Group Awareness Training).


In the grand scheme of things, it’s just as well because you should really be focused on the
near present and not shifting around subjects so often anyway.

Melt the chains of the past to forge to tools of the future.(xx do it in the book)

Terms like Faith, justice, liberty, honesty, truth, honor, love, god have old, less useful
meanings. Redirect their energy into your own.

Like taking over a machine gun on the beach at Normandy, you can now point it at the
team that used to control it. The great power that they used to wield has now gone
the other direction and increased the amplitude versus them. Liberate them usinf

Value of logos

Great marketing invovles branding, stylization, packaging, color, contrast and texture in all
the things that make one product shit on another product. Literally, you will see 100% more
value on the better packaged product. Why do you think a video card comes in such a big
box? All video cards can come in little tiny boxes. It's all empty space. Why the big boxes?
I've seen all kinds of things, including soups at restaurants that come in giant plates and
giant bowls with little circles around them, but in reality what you're getting is quite small
because packaging matters a lot, perception matters a lot. What someone else told you
about something matters a lot. What would be the best thing to put on an idea to represent
an idea? What would be the best thing to put on a book to represent a book? What's the
best thing to put on a company to represent a company? What the world has converged on
as the most hyper useful symbology - it is a logo or a symbol. You'll see throughout history
that the most powerful ideas are associated with a logo. Even countries have flags. What is a


















flag? Flag is a logo for a country. Families used to have code of arms. What's a code of arms?
It's a brandable logo for your family corporation group.

Popularizing good ideas is more valuable than creating good ideas.

This concept of assigning a powerful, unique, brandable, memorable symbol to a thing
which can be believed in, or bought, or understood to me is super powerful, because I'm
selling people a way of believing and a way of existing that I think is better than most of the
other ones people actually follow. I don't know how much of the good life that I've had has
been a result of executing a lot of these beliefs I have. If you want to measure up, for
instance, people that create belief systems and where they were when they created them, I
don't know of anyone else that was successful anywhere else before they created their
belief system. I don't think Marx was successful in business. I don't thing Keynes was
successful in business - he's responsible for all the economic policies we have, and those are
most important than most anything else. Maybe, maybe Islam is coming up as more and
more important as WMDs become easier to acquire. All the people that have created all of
the ideas that are executed in the world that we live in were shittier off than I am. I'm doing
better than all of those guys. If you want to think that there's some prerequisite
performance that you have before you create a belief system that you can feel confident in
spreading around, look at all the other belief systems that are out there and take a look at
where the people were in their lives before they created those. The first thing they ever did
that was good was start selling that idea, but prior to selling that idea they weren't making
cash, having sensual success nor doing anything that a man would really be vibed about.
Now, that's a wide brush. The guy that invented Scientology that affects millions of lives and
has billions of dollars of assets - he was a failed science fiction author. That's what he was.
Failed science fiction author that literally became basically a god to millions of people. I can
spread better things with more wholesome intention, less culty, faggotry, bullshit. Just an
honest... it's like Benjamin Franklin wrote "Good Richard's Almanac." Or... is that what it's
called? I have to XX that. I need to look up what Benjamin Franklin's... It was basically: Here's
how you should do everything. If you want a man to like you more, ask him to do a small
thing for you. Once he does that small thing for you, now he'll like you because he thinks
that he should like you because he just did something for you. This creates incongruence in
your head, Benjamin Franklin coined that. If he didn't identify it, he at least popularized it.
Just like Ford didn't invent the assembly line, he popularized it. He didn't invent the
automobile, he popularized it. Edison apparently didn't invent the light bulb, but he got it to
work.

Use the tools of business to sell great ideas

If companies and ideas are best represented by symbols and is the reason that you see
symbolic being used that predates human language that predates human speech. Symbols
and assigning meanings to symbols has been around for a really long time. It’s really
effective. It's the reason that most successful companies have a logo and a certain color
scheme they use, and a certain placement in the purchaser's mind in regards to whether
they're better or worse than other companies for a specific thing. That's why companies use
halo products because they want all their other products to look better. Therefore, they
release one amazing product so at least you know that the company's capable of great
quality when they choose to be. Then, you assume that that applies otherwise in other
places in their life, just as you assume that a person that is good at something has a
capability to be good at other things as well. Or, as a person that is to the best of your
knowledge good at nothing. You're likely to assume is good at nothing anywhere else as
well. Good movements should have logos, brands, the mnemonic techniques, slogans,



placement and unique benefit statements and money back guarantees and every interesting
useful, powerful effective thing that exists in business for selling products. These should also
exist for selling ideas. If product packaging is so important in the retail areas of life, then
why don't we see ideas with as much focus on the packaging. Hey! Become Jewish, Jewish
people are some of the richest people in the world, what we do works. Now that can be true
or false, who knows, but some portion of the people exposed to that idea would see it as
compelling, and would act upon it and may give competitive advantage to Jewish people for
the acquisition of new followers.

Branding great ideas

There's all types of packaging around ideas, phraseology, product placement and money
back guarantee as unlimited time offers and things that motivate human beings to adopt
products, and why not also like vacationing and sports behavior, into their life and. Those
things are the result of well-structured, well designed marketing. I don't see anyone
majoring in idea packaging and sales for ideas that aren't profitable. This is because some of
the best ideas you'll ever learn, no one's making any money on. If I teach you that the best
way to divide a cake between two children with the children cutting it is to introduce the
restriction that one person cuts and one person chooses. It's a magical logical strategy that I
really haven't seen equal from, and I've looked and will continue to look for that type of
amazingly simple awesome, fairness generating strategy that if one person cuts the other
person chooses. The person who cuts will make the absolute most perfect cut down the
middle. It's similar to how we have prevention of conflict of interest. One lawyer can't
represent two parties that are in a conflicting arrangement. A doctor can't make money
prescribing you to get tests. A judge can't make money by sending you to a for-profit jail, be
paid by the customer and get a check every time he sends a new person to that jail. Those
strategies for preventing conflicts of interest and assuming that even honest people can be
corrupted with strong enough perverse incentives. I think that that type of great thinking
and great logic, an application of successful business practices should be picked, employed
in less profitable, but infinitely more wholesome and useful places in the world in regards to
being ethical, a good person and doing good things. Those ideas aren't being promoted,
packaged nor branded. They also aren't being made exclusive and don't have a members
reward card and don't get you discounts. But they could. Whoever solves that problem
makes the world a much better place.

The point of that last paragraph was the successful billions and of dollars, trillions of dollars
of commerce that runs on those strategies should be used for good ideas and religious
strategies. If those good ideas out there in the world that aren't being promoted using
business tactics and they're not being promoted using the religious tactics, at some point
you just got to decide that those things aren't being promoted properly. If they're worthy of
it, someone needs to actually do that form of promotion.

Science amplifies medicine and much more

Doctors apply what researchers create. Researchers create with fancy computers, machines,
imaging, chemicals, compounds, you name it. Lots and lots of non-medical science goes into
nearly all the things that the medical industry considers progress. There is no medical
progress without general scientific progress. General scientific progress is the tide that rises
all ships. Obviously we can influence which parts of the science get focused on to be more
useful to the medical fields. There's also all kinds of side benefits from great science that
improves the quality of life that you just can't get by focusing on medicine alone. You really
can't forget the engineers, businessmen, legal systems, salesmen that allow all these great



things to literally reach you. If you are making a Rate my sandwich - app though, fuck you. I
hope you find a more empowering and fulfilling use for your creative skills.
